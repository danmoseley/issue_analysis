        "body":  "Below is one option we\u0027ve considered, but I\u0027m re-framing this issue to build *some* story for refreshing auth tokens.\r\n\r\nTo improve the ability to \"refresh\" expired tokens, we should consider caching the access token provided by the factory. Then, when an HTTP request gets a `401`, we call the factory again before re-issuing the request. That way the user can configure a process to \"refresh\" the token without forcing the connection to be reestablished\r\n\r\n* For the WebSockets transport, this has no effect. There is only ever a single request. This logic would **not** cover reconnecting in the event of something like #1159 (where the WebSocket is terminated when the token expires)\r\n* For the SSE transport, this only affects `POST` (send) requests. We would call the token factory again and re-issue the send. The unsent data would stay buffered in the pipe\r\n* For Long Polling, this affects `POST` requests like SSE, and the `GET` (poll) requests. The client would assume that a `401` error indicates that the data is **still in the pipe** for them to read. The server would be expected to keep data in the pipe in the case of a `401`",

And it adds some work for the appilcation developer to make sure the access token is always fresh. I think it makes sense to add it to the SignalR library where the developer can opt in the feature #14578\r\nI don\u0027t like the approach of closing the connection to then refresh the access token and then connect with the new access token. It does the job, but it\u0027s slow and hacky. There is also the possibility that the backend gets confused because of a completely new connectionId.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I see a second problem arising, which is not solved by keeping the access token fresh. And that is changing roles within the access token.\r\nFor that let me give an example.\r\n\r\nYou have a priviliged user that manages other users in your application. The priviliged user then removes a role from one of the users he manages (e.g. removes the role of adding comment to you blogpost). Assuming this communication is via SignalR and the access token is always valid (not expired) then the user is still authorized to the the tasks (comment on your blogpost) he just was removed from. In the worst case, the access token was just refreshed and the user can abuse his roles up to EXPIRATION_TIME (e.g. 4 minutes).\r\n\r\nThis is a more complex problem to solve then just making sure that the token is always valid, because the Identity Provider needs to inform you that the roles of a user were updated.\r\n\r\nTo sum this up. \r\nI see two problems with signalR and authorization. The first is that the access token is never looked at after the inital connection and second updating roles while a connection is live.\r\nI think we should focus on the first one (keeping the access token fresh). I think it would already help a lot of developers when SignalR with websockets support this feature.",

Everything that relates to the connection would be thrown away, while what we actually want to achieve is a \"cache invalidation\" on the side of the hub with the support of the client. Couldn\u0027t we think about it from the \"bi-directional communication feature\" perspective of SignalR itself?\r\n\r\n1. Hub informs clients some seconds (configurable) before the access token will become invalid. Either because of a timer or because of the heartbeat mechanism. The hub has to know about it, because it persists/caches the initial access token and relates it to the connection itself.\r\n2. Clients can react to this event, that is triggered by the hub to then re-send their access token (which should be refreshed by their local access token handling mechanism anyways) to allow the hub to update the authorization properties related to the client.\r\n3. The hub receives the updated token from the client and overwrites all related ClaimsPrincipal properties for the sending client and therefore updates its internally cached/connectation related state to reflect the latest acces token content.\r\n4. Because of this update, if we remove a role from a client (like described by @SebastianKunz f.e.), this change will be reflected with the next access token refresh cycle, which usually should take 5 minutes maximum.",

The team is looking at ways to keep the make sure there\u0027s a new auth token that represents the updated user information. Since SignalR isn\u0027t a simple request-response based system, it\u0027s challenging and anything we do here will require protocol changes (that means new client and server changes). \r\n\r\nThere are 2 approaches being considered:\r\n\r\n1. A way to renew user information using [the transport protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/f543e3552514c5c420eeddd55c505bbc131f10a6/src/SignalR/docs/specs/TransportProtocols.md) (HTTP in the common case) \r\n2. A way to renew the user information in [the hub protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/f543e3552514c5c420eeddd55c505bbc131f10a6/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md) \r\n\r\nDoing auth at the transport layer lets us reuse all of the ASP.NET Core based authentication handlers so it\u0027s attractive. Doing it over the transport means we need to encode the auth representation in the hub protocol and then have code on the server side that understands how to \"unpack\" the token (the equivalent of auth handlers but for SignalR specifically).\r\n\r\nThese are the forms of auth being looked at:\r\n\r\n- Cookie \r\n- JWT (generally bearer tokens)\r\n- Cert\r\n- API-Key\r\n",

Sure I could do it though method parameters but that\u0027s ugly especially when there is an elegant way to do it on initial connection. Then on the back end we could develop more unified ways to custom handle those tokens, update identity, and so on.",

That\u0027s my opinion based on the experience working at multiple .net Maui and asp.net core projects. Reported over 12 issues and followed a lot more of already reported issues that I as well encountered in those projects. And still a lot of the issues are still remaining present in the latest versions.",

To optimize it, you can cache it until expiry and request a new one only if expired.\n\u003e \n\u003e ```ts\n\u003e     const hubConnectionBuilder = new HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl(this.SERVER_HUB_URL, {\n\u003e       transport: HttpTransportType.None,\n\u003e       logger: LogLevel.Debug,\n\u003e       accessTokenFactory: () =\u003e this.identityService.getToken()\n\u003e     });\n\u003e ```\n\nThis does not solve the original issue. The issue is that a reconnect is required to revaildet the token if its expired and that requires a full reconnect and if a client is connected without any connection loss even the token is invalid he can still accces protected hub methods etc . And some other issues that\u0027d come with the whole auth system of signalR just read the thread  ",

No one is refreshing token until logout/login?\n\nBy default this is pretty much the issue, the token request does not happen until an HTTP request goes out, which doesn\u0027t happen often as most communication is facilitated via WebSocket. \n\nMaybe the thought process here is that since the connection remains open it doesn\u0027t require re-validation? Not sure I agree with this.\n\nJust seems wrong when I\u0027m adding methods on the hub for them to not check for a valid token on each request. And when an invalid token is found just abort the connection. My current workaround is two-fold: on the hub add a method that informs whether the token is valid; on the client check with the hub each request whether the token is valid and reconnect when it is not. Additionally, the hub will do a single retry if the request failed due to closure from the hub.",

It\u0027s just when you call \"stream.write(5)\" it generates and sends a stream item right there in the write method. The bad part is that you can only call this after making the invocation, whereas with a channel you can load items and then call afterwards.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// channel style\r\nvar channel = Channel.CreateUnbounded\u003cFoo\u003e();\r\nforeach (foo in foos) {\r\n  channel.Write(foo);\r\n}\r\nvar result = await connection.invokeAsync(\"collectFoos\", channel);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// flat placeholder style\r\nvar stream = connection.NewUploadStream();\r\nvar promise = connection.invoke(\"collectFoos\", stream);\r\nforeach (foo in foos) {\r\n    await stream.write(foo);\r\n}\r\nvar result = await promise;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe channel style one is definitely more elegant / more slick. The flat placeholder one better describes the underlying process; or the order in which things happen is more transparent.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is just implement something similar in C#. Probably beef up the StreamPlaceholder class substantially, and have users call `stream.write(item)` like in typescript. This lets people do stuff like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nforeach (byte[] chunk in myFile) {\r\n    await stream.write(chunk);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo basically this would allow for every iterable to be supported.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that there\u0027s something fun or magical about sending a channel \"through to the server\", and the nicer async staging results in cleaner code.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

I handle creating the corresponding objects manually on the client and all works fine. But, it does\u0027t work when I want to deserialize message to a class that contain union.  I have the following class on the server side:\r\n```\r\npublic RegisterProduct \r\n{\r\n   [Key(\"product\")]\r\n   public IProductModel Product { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI send the following object from the client:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      product: new ProductEx0()     \r\n}\r\n```\r\nMessagePack on server side throws error:\r\n\r\n\u003e  System.InvalidOperationException: code is invalid. code:129 format:fixmap\r\n\r\nI understand that Union types are encoded in different way, but from the client I send simple model. therefore messagepack cannot handle it.\r\n",

Calling it would throw then. We can put it in an `#ifdef` but then user code would need to define the `DEFINE` in order to use the API.\r\n  - Or we could look into exposing the `hub_protocol` class in which case we\u0027d also make `messagepack_hub_protocol` public\r\n* Should `build()` return a pointer or `shared_ptr`?\r\n  - pointer likely makes a C-wrapper easier, but does require users to call `delete` when they are done with the connection, or to wrap the pointer in a `shared_ptr` themselves (edit: looked into C-wrapper a little and it likely doesn\u0027t care)\r\n* .NET client uses many `WithUrl` overloads to configure http options\r\n\u003c/details\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdetails\u003e\r\n\u003csummary\u003ehub_connection.h\u003c/summary\u003e\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nnamespace signalr\r\n{\r\n    class

What about STL? VCPKG should help avoid issues with different versions of the STL.\r\n3. We should consider header file names. Let\u0027s update the usage examples with `#include ...`\r\n4. `hub_connection_builder.create(string)` vs `withUrl()`. `create(string)` seems fine.\r\n5. Should `build()` return a pointer or `shared_ptr`? We think pointer is fine. You can create a `shared_ptr` if you want.\r\n6. Should `hub_connection_builder.create` return a pointer? Does `hub_connection_builder` need a copy constructor if it\u0027s mostly tracking references so it\u0027s not really a copy?\r\n7. Does `with_logging` need a `shared_ptr`? It feels safer. Logging can happen in the background.\r\n8. Let\u0027s try removing the CPPRESTSDK-specific APIs from `signalr_client_config` and see if we get pushback. If something like proxy support is really needed, we can consider adding support to http_client.h.\r\n9. Name `with_websocket_factory` parameter `websocket_factory` instead of `factory`.\r\n10. Do we want to support building a `hub_connection_builder` more than once? Not for now.\r\n11. Let\u0027s have `with_websocket_factory` and `with_http_client_factory` take `std::function\u003cwebsocket_client*\u003e`/`std::function\u003chttp_client*\u003e` instead of a `shared_ptr`.\r\n12. Is there an `#ifdef` for `with_messagepack_hub_protocol`? Inside of it yes. It\u0027s not really discoverable if we remove the public API by default. It will throw at runtime if you\u0027re missing the define. But the API is always available.\r\n\r\nTBC",

Someone would need to place it in a global/another class and then use it via some methods on their class.\r\n\r\nBased on the statement, \"We think pointer is fine. You can create a shared_ptr if you want.\", there is an expectation for users to take a raw pointer and create a `shared_ptr\u003cT\u003e`, right? In the current form you are saying \"here is a raw pointer with no assumptions about ownership, do as you please\". That is wrong because if a user can immediately wrap the raw pointer it **implies** the pointer is owned by the caller. However, if you provide `unique_ptr\u003cT\u003e`, then the caller knows they own it and can do as they please safely. The `shared_ptr\u003cT\u003e` ctor accepts an R-value reference of a `unique_ptr\u003cT\u003e` specifically to indicate these ownership semantics and does it explicitly.\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason to use raw pointers at an API level in C++14. In C++11 there are a few cases, but none jumped out to me in the above API. Working through some use cases with the GSL would help with some of this.",

We like the chaining of the `hub_connection_builder` methods.\r\n3. If we are copying the `std::map`, just pass it by value unless we\u0027re processing the data inline.\r\n    - Same goes for `configure_options(const signalr_client_config\u0026 config)`. It should be `configure_options(signalr_client_config config)`.\r\n5. If you build a copy of a `hub_connection_builder`, are all copies \"built\" meaning they cannot be built again?\r\n    - Let\u0027s change `create(string)` to a ctor and get rid of the copy constructor.\r\n6. Do we need a public API to set HTTP headers if only SignalR itself sets them? No. `http_request` should be read-only and `http_response` can be write-only.\r\n7. Why both `get_http_headers() const noexcept;` and `std::map\u003cstd::string, std::string\u003e\u0026 get_http_headers() noexcept;`.\r\n8. Should we even allow the transport to modify the `signalr_client_config`. It cannot because we pass it to the transport by `const`.\r\n9. The non-const `std::map\u003cstd::string, std::string\u003e\u0026 get_http_headers()` should be removed.\r\n10. Is the `scheduler` from `const std::shared_ptr\u003cscheduler\u003e\u0026 get_scheduler() const noexcept;` being stored? Yes. Let\u0027s just make it `std::shared_ptr\u003cscheduler\u003e get_scheduler() const noexcept;`. No const references for returns (probably).\r\n11. `std::function\u003cstd::shared_ptr\u003cwebsocket_client\u003e(const signalr_client_config\u0026)\u003e websocket_factory` should be using `unique_ptr` just like `hub_connection_builder.build()`.\r\n12. Always take `std::function` by value if you are storing it after the call.\r\n13. Remove all the public constructors and assignment operators from `hub_connection` since we\u0027re now handing out a `unique_ptr`.\r\n14. Let\u0027s remove all the typedefs for functions like `method_invoked_handler`.\r\n15. `std::exception_ptr` is a bad API. We could pass a copy of the exception object itself but we\u0027d lose info like the stack trace. Or... `std::function\u003cvoid(std::exception_ptr)\u003e callback` could be `std::function\u003cvoid(const std::exception*)\u003e callback`.\r\n16. Remove the `__cdecl`.\r\n17. Rename `set_disconnected` to `on_disconnected`.\r\n18. Is `on` additive? Yes. Let\u0027s make it the same for `on_disconnected`.\r\n19. Do we need the ability to remove `on` callbacks? Maybe. We could theoretically add a registration return value later and add an `off` method.\r\n20. `const std::string\u0026` vs `const char*`? `const std::string\u0026` is better.\r\n21.

Use `*.hpp` instead of `*.h` for all header files since we\u0027re using C++ even if it is header-only with no code.\r\n3. Use `\u003c` instead of `\"` for includes.\r\n4. Let\u0027s stick with `unique_ptr` for `with_websocket_factory ` and `with_http_client_factory`. We\u0027re convinced we can make the tests work somehow.\r\n5. Friend classes are cool!\r\n6. Let\u0027s mark setters in `signalr_client_config` with `noexcept`. Do a `noexcept` pass.\r\n7. Can we replicate `std::variant` or use it for `signalr_value`? No. It\u0027s C++14 and greater and the `index` API is unnecessary for a custom tagged union.\r\n8. Pass parameters by value instead of reference to `value` constructors since we\u0027re just copying in the constructor anyway.\r\n9. Remove `value(const char* val)`. It\u0027s not too hard to have the user convert to `std::string` themselves.\r\n10. `value_type.null` is a unique concept because we don\u0027t know the type we\u0027re extracting to. Given null, `is_string` will return false, `as_string` will throw, etc... We could return a `unique_ptr` from `as_string` to return \"null\", but this seems unwieldy. Custom converters can manually check `is_null` for nullable properties.\r\n11. Let\u0027s move `value_type` into `value` and rename it to `type`.\r\n12. Enums should not have `: int`\r\n13. Should the 0 `log_level` be `none` to be more consistent with C++ libraries? It\u0027s probably better to align with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging LogLevel, but we should think about it.\r\n14. Do we need categories for logs? Can we use less log levels? Error, debug, none?\r\n15. Let\u0027s rename `trace_level` to `log_level`.\r\n16. How do we flow the log writer and logger config to the transport and http client? Should we add it to `signalr_client_config`? Or should we force people to wire the logger themselves to custom transports and client?\r\n17. All destructors should be marked `noexcept`.\r\n18. Can we put `http_method` instead `http_request`? Would we rename it to just `method` if it\u0027s nested? Probably.\r\n19. Can `websocket_client` be turned into an arbitrary transport? It\u0027s really close. The registration would have to change so `with_websocket_factory` is now called `with_transport_factory` and could take `transport_type` as the first parameter.\r\n20. We assume the `std::string` used by `http_response` are UTF-8 encoded chars. Can we make it `Vector\u003cuint8_t\u003e`? Is there away to avoid copying. If the only callback reading the buffer is internal code, maybe it\u0027s okay to just take a pointer and length and promise to do any copying we need in the callback.\r\n21.

If this is not the best place for that please direct me to some other place where it would be more appropriate.\r\n\r\n**BACKGROUND**\r\n\r\nI\u0027m trying to integrate some SignalR C++ Client code to our pet game project which uses Unreal Engine. UE4 uses paranoid warning level while compiling sources and treat warnings as errors. It also still depends on old gnustl version (GCC 4.9) on Android (but this is another story...).\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s especially interesting for us to try to integrate SignalR C++ Client code using UE\u0027s implementations of http/websocket clients, json library, build system, etc. instead of cpprestsdk, boost, cmake, etc.\r\n\r\nI have no much expertise in C++ so my considerations easily can be irrelevant. If so feel free to ignore them :) \r\n\r\n**CONSIDERATIONS**\r\n\r\n**1.** The existence of `make_unique.h` file causes ambiguous function error when compiling with Clang for Linux (or with GCC 4.9 for Android - I may be wrong here because I don\u0027t remember exactly). I deleted this file and the error is gone on all platforms which I tried;\r\n- Windows + MSVC (VS 2019 v16.4.4)\r\n- Linux + Clang 8.0.1 (bundled with UE)\r\n- iOS SDK 13.2\r\n- Android NDK r17c (GCC 4.9)\r\n\r\nSo is it actually needed? I may add that old gnustl on Android lacks `std:to_string()`. But as I can see both functions are parts of C++11, so it also would be great to add list of supported compiler versions in repository main README.\r\n\r\n**2.** There is one place in whole project where `dynamic_cast\u003c\u003e()` is used. `connection_impl.cpp` file:\r\n```\r\n                        catch (const std::exception\u0026 e)\r\n                        {\r\n                            auto canceled = dynamic_cast\u003cconst canceled_exception*\u003e(\u0026e);\r\n                            if (canceled)\r\n                            {\r\n                                connection-\u003em_logger.log(trace_level::info,\r\n                                    \"starting the connection has been canceled.\");\r\n                            }\r\n                            else\r\n                            {\r\n                                connection-\u003em_logger.log(trace_level::errors,\r\n                                    std::string(\"connection could not be started due to: \")\r\n                                    .append(e.what()));\r\n                            }\r\n```\r\nIt is possible to compile SignalR C++ Client without RTTI if we remove this special `dynamic_cast\u003c\u003e()` case, enable exceptions and link to UE\u0027s http, json, etc. libs which are also compiled without RTTI. Will this lead to any problems with exceptions behaviour at runtime? Is this special case so important to mandate RTTI?\r\n\r\n**3.** At the very end of `json_hub_protocol.cpp` file the `return` statement uses `std::move()`, which prevents copy elision:\r\n```\r\n            // Future protocol changes can add message types, old clients can ignore them\r\n            // TODO: null\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return std::move(value);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**4.** `log_writer` has virtual method:\r\n```\r\n    class log_writer\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        // NOTE: the caller does not enforce thread safety of this call\r\n        SIGNALRCLIENT_API virtual void write(const std::string \u0026entry) = 0;\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nand derived type:\r\n```\r\n    class trace_log_writer : public log_writer\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        void write(const std::string \u0026entry) override;\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nSo `log_writer` should also have virtual destructor.\r\n\r\n**5.** `signalr_value` has union with complex types:\r\n```\r\n        union storage\r\n        {\r\n            bool boolean;\r\n            std::string string;\r\n            std::vector\u003cvalue\u003e array;\r\n            double number;\r\n            std::map\u003cstd::string, value\u003e map;\r\n\r\n            storage() {}\r\n            ~storage() {}\r\n        };\r\n```\r\nThis causes MSVC warnings 4582 and 4583 ([link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warnings-c4400-through-c4599)) because union shares the memory between fields and doesn\u0027t know how to create/destroy complex objects. Potential memory leak?\r\n\r\n**6.** Initialization list reordering. There are three:\r\n- in `hub_connection_impl` constructor `m_handshakeReceived` must be placed before `m_disconnected`;\r\n- in `websocket_transport` constructor:\r\n-- `m_signalr_client_config` must be placed before `m_receive_loop_cts`;\r\n-- `m_process_response_callback` must be placed before `m_close_callback`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**P.S.** Header inclusion order is a mess :)",

The problem here is that UE depends on gnustl on Android) I.e. r17c is latest version of NDK which may be used with UE. This is not your problem of course, that\u0027s why I suggested to add list of supported compiler versions in README. I believe this would be very convenient for potential users of your code.\r\n\r\nSome official support for non-RTTI compilation (in case of excluding cpprestsdk and boost) from your side would be very helpful, thanks!",

        "body":  "### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\nI have a use case when server initiates a workflow with the client. Conventional SignalR call gives ability to pick specific client during invocation (`MyHub.Clients.Client(\"clientid\").SendAsync`), but streaming doesn\u0027t (or it is not documented).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nTo have ability to stream to a specific client.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered\r\nI don\u0027t see a workaround since my application is distributed and if I do not \"set up\" a stream to the client on the first call (e.g. do `Client(\"clientid\").SendAsync` and then open stream from the client), the response might be routed to random application instance which is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThere is a ASP.NET Core application deployed to two regions - US and EU. It runs behind Traffic Manager and contains a SignalR hub and uses Azure SignalR Service (single US instance) as backplane for scaling purposes.\r\nThe hub interacts with the client in synchronous way - calls value-returning method and waits until it returns. The locking mechanism is implemented on top of in-memory collection of tasks, and thus there are problems when server-to-client communication originates on one instance (say EU), but client-to-server \"response\" is returned to another (US) - first application instance is locked indefinitely, because it never receives the response for the request, and second instance does nothing because it cannot map the response to any previous request. I\u0027ve tried brand new `ServerStickyMode=Required` mode for Azure SignalR, but it does not help since my client is permanently in US -\u003e `Connect` is always hitting US application -\u003e all responses are \"stuck\" to US instance as well. I suspect streaming can help me with this scenario.",

Meanwhile I\u0027ve implemented a PoC of a protocol with flow that originates on the client - it sends a stream (locks after each `Write` portion) and hub responds to each message with `Clients.Caller` (each received response removes corresponding lock on the client and moves to next step).\r\nLooking forward the same flow that starts from hub because this is what I was shooting for initially. Maybe there is a way... Although I understand I\u0027m kind of misusing the approach and trying to have stream \"open\" for a long time would presumably have a bunch of side-effects.\r\np.s.

My app uses \"Bearer\" authentication for the Blazor wasm stuff and the usual REST api stuff, but within the UI it also allows the user to create custom, scoped, api keys so they can write their own code to interact with the application\u0027s REST api. To support this, I\u0027ve added a custom authentication scheme to the application, which allows the app to accept Authorization tokens of type either `Bearer` or `MyCustomScheme`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I want to allow the user to write their own code to connect to a signalR hub, for better performance, they are not able to authenticate a signalR client using the custom scheme. I\u0027d love my public api to provide SignalR in addition to the usual REST api stuff. I would prefer the solution presented by @stephenlautier, but I\u0027ll check out the alternatives I can find in the configuration docs. Thank you.",

My app uses \"Bearer\" authentication for the Blazor wasm stuff and the usual REST api stuff, but within the UI it also allows the user to create custom, scoped, api keys so they can write their own code to interact with the application\u0027s REST api. To support this, I\u0027ve added a custom authentication scheme to the application, which allows the app to accept Authorization tokens of type either `Bearer` or `MyCustomScheme`.\n\u003e \n\u003e However, if I want to allow the user to write their own code to connect to a signalR hub, for better performance, they are not able to authenticate a signalR client using the custom scheme. I\u0027d love my public api to provide SignalR in addition to the usual REST api stuff. I would prefer the solution presented by [@stephenlautier](https://github.com/stephenlautier), but I\u0027ll check out the alternatives I can find in the configuration docs. Thank you.\n\n@truegoodwill  Did you found a solution for your issue?",

As far as I understood this token only cancels the invocation (and waiting for a result, ...) on the client, while on the server side the method proceeds.\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nIf so wouldn´t it be a nice feature to allow such a cancellation? I saw that Google offers this possibility in their [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts/) framework aswell:\r\n\r\n\u003e Cancelling RPCs\r\nEither the client or the server can cancel an RPC at any time. A cancellation terminates the RPC immediately so that no further work is done. It is not an “undo”: changes made before the cancellation will not be rolled back.\r\n\r\nWhen my understanding is wrong please provide me an example on how to do a cancellation of long running hub methods from the client.",

There are 3 main actors involved: caller, signaling server and a callee. There\u0027s a method the caller calls to initiate a call and notify the callee. Ideally, method would wait for the callee to answer and return the information required for the call to be established. There is a problem, however: if the caller decides to cancel a call there\u0027s no way for us to cancel the initialization method. Due to this issue, currently we immediately return from the initialization method and use another server-\u003eclient callback to inform of the result and one more client-\u003eserver method to inform the signaling server if the caller has cancelled the call.\r\nIf we had a way for the caller to cancel the initialization method it would remove the need of those two additional methods.",

These clients waits for results (listen to SignalR), but it is quite common that these clients need to stop processing these requests. Now, we are cancelling these async operations via cancellation token on client side, but server-side is still running even if it is not necessary.\r\nOur solution architecture is like this: Clients (WPF/Blazor/etc) =\u003e WebAPI =\u003e Application =\u003e DB",

But, unfortunately, this cancelation means nothing on Server side.\r\nAs result user can star-stop N times this process. And all these N processes will be running on server side until they will be finished.\r\n\r\nFrom our point of view cancelation is quite important functionality.\r\nEspecially if take in account that implemented interfaces assume it should work (i.e. presence of CancelationToken).\r\nIt took some time for us to figure out that it does not work.\r\n\r\nPlease implement this ticket.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Our company is currently in the process of replacing .NET Remoting with SignalR and it would simplify a lot, if server-side Requests including EF-Database queries could be cancelled from the Client with a CancellationToken.\n\nWe have seen following issues with the current state:\n\n- We could use the Streaming API for Cancellation, so basically return IAsyncEnumerable\u003cT\u003e everywhere. But this is not idiomatic. It may make sense for cases, where the server returns many results which the client needs to iterate. But oftentimes the client just needs a single value or needs to wait for a process to finish. Returning IAsyncEnumerable\u003cT\u003e for those things is very confusing.\n\n- Currently, clients can basically DOS-Attack our Server, by starting many heavy requests on the server without waiting for its results.\n\nWe also want to share a very rare, but hard-to-debug issue we encountered:\n\nA long time ago we used following code with our HubConnectionBuilder:\n```csharp\n                    .AddNewtonsoftJsonProtocol(options =\u003e\n                    {\n                        // ACHTUNG! Gleiche Serialisierungseinstellungen auch auf dem Server setzen.\n                        options.PayloadSerializerSettings.TypeNameHandling = TypeNameHandling.Objects;\n                    });\n```\nThe reason was, that System.Text.Json was not able to handle class polymorphism before (it does now, so TypeNameHandling.Objects is not necessary anymore). Our SignalR hub expected a CancellationToken and our Client client passed one in. But what really happened was, that Newtonsoft.Json serialized the CancellationToken to the server which deserialized it. This worked until Garbage Collection, where an SEHException was thrown because the internal handle was invalid.\n\nWe may very well be the only ones, who had this problem. But it hints at the fact, that the current API is very confusing in this regard. You may believe, that the Server will cancel the request, but it actually doesn\u0027t.",

        "body":  "Right now, it\u0027s only possible to use TestServer with the non-WebSockets transports because we only provide a way to replace the `HttpMessageHandler`. We should consider providing a way to provide a `WebSocket` \"factory\" so that we can integrate properly with TestServer.\r\n\r\nIt might be most appropriate here to add an alternative to `WithUrl` on `HubConnectionBuilder`. Consider this possible test code:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar server = new TestServer(webHostBuilder);\r\nvar connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n\t.WithTestServer(server, HttpTransportType.WebSockets, o =\u003e {\r\n\t\t// Assorted other HttpConnectionOptions\r\n\t})\r\n\t.Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be relatively simple to add this API once we have a way to swap out the WebSocket, though we\u0027d probably need to do so in a new assembly to avoid layering issues.",

It is really hard to use any .NET library, that wasn\u0027t meant to be used in Unity. Apart from not always playing super nice with IL2CPP the .NET SignalR client pulls in a quite sizable amount of ASP.NET Core dependencies. That works fine for anything that uses NuGet but it falls flat in Unity (afaik the Unity package manger has no NuGet interop). If it is the goal to write a Unity client for SignalR I\u0027d basically treat it as I would any non CLR language (like Java, JS, etc) and don\u0027t try to force the conventional client into an environment where it is setup for failure.",

Correct? You are correct that there\u0027s only one `IUserIdProvider` for the entire app. There may be something on the `HubConnectionContext` that\u0027s passed in you could use to identify the Hub associated with the connection and you could use that to change the logic you use to generate the User Identifier. I don\u0027t know of something off-hand but @BrennanConroy could take a look and see ;)",

As soon as I enabled debug logging I tracked the issue quickly. \r\n\r\nI can\u0027t see why response buffering wouldn\u0027t technically work as it would be fairly trivial to write the JSON in memory (potentially backed by disk for large objects) before sending it down the socket. I agree though that this doesn\u0027t feel like the correct option. Technically, this could be simulated very easily with existing infrastructure by serializing the object to JSON before writing it to the Channel and then wrapping it in a JSONWrapper struct before sending it to the channel. A CustonConverter could then be used  to write raw the unwrapped JSON (although not sure the new System.Text.Json supports raw, I think I looked into this already for supported the proposed n suffix for bigint). \r\n\r\nAnother option would be to support streaming a single message across multiple frames (streaming json) in the front end. This would allow for additional messages to be injected between frames to indicate error, e.g. first frame contains partial json, next frame contains a header indicated an error. Potentially a JSON (2) protocol?\r\n\r\nI haven\u0027t thought any of this through in any detail, just putting some ideas out there :) Clearly the other option is to test my code better!! \r\n\r\nThanks all, I appreciate the fast response on this \r\n",

I put in a custom double converter quickly and this seemed to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n@suedama1756, can you expand a bit on this? What\u0027s your input object that you are serializing and where do you end up seeing these unsupported double values that caused you to write a custom converter? I am interested in learning about that scenario, and if you could share an isolated sample (specific to the serializer itself, including the converter), that would be helpful to me (particularly because I don\u0027t think the serializer should be writing NaN/Infinity on .NET Core).",

The biggest cost here is that we\u0027d need to track every connection we\u0027ve sent to, which means allocating a lot of memory to hold a list of all the connection IDs we\u0027ve sent to.\r\n\r\nThis is going on the backlog for now, as it\u0027s quite a big change. We may be able to look at it in a future release.\r\n\r\nUntil then, this is effectively by design. Your client application should be configured to be resilient to this by using some kind of idempotency token on the messages you send (so that when the client receives two messages with the same token value, it ignores the duplicates).",

There is no circumstance in which the framework can deal with this, but since I am being notified every time a message successfully routes - I can take that on at the app level, and act on it if I need to.  This is very app dependent.\r\n\r\nAn attacker connects to a hub and spools messages that don\u0027t deserialize successfully.  Right now this is a silent failure case, and so an attacker can use it to burn resources.  Adding any delegate based approach helps, however if you assume the attacker is spooling messages as fast as possible, the event pattern is likely to cause more allocation and garbage collection, and so it\u0027d be smarter to just call a delegate and then let the user route that to a pub/sub pattern if they need multicast, since I\u0027d expect that to be the exception not the rule (pun intended).\r\n\r\nAn attacker connects to a hub and sends messages the serializer does successfully deserialize, but which cannot be successfully routed.  This could be intentional - we did it all the time in Gasper Vantage with our internal library, back when I worked for NCR (cue: \"oh and you stole from poor people too\" comments).  It also could be a bug.  Having a notification - again, any delegate based mechanism works but event might cause excessive allocations - would be helpful.  In this case, since there is already garbage since we deserialized an object successfully, the event pattern wouldn\u0027t add much to garbage collection on paper.  But \"not adding much\" might be relevant.\r\n\r\nThere wouldn\u0027t be any impact to code that doesn\u0027t want / need to know from having the event - but it\u0027d help people dealing with the one bad person on all of Internet. ;)\r\n\r\nWith Gasper Vantage, we had to maintain a million message an hour target on 1995 era hardware.  When I started, we had to do it on Windows 3.1 (the DOS product had a lower threshold).  That was rough - real rough - with the entire operating system operating against us.\r\n\r\n@HeikoBoettger \r\nYou can have logging, in your production system - it\u0027s saved me more times than I can count.  Focus it, be able to turn your instrumentation on and off in production without restarting your entire farm of containers.\r\n\r\nHowever, be aware the disk can\u0027t be in two places at once, and if I\u0027m trying to burn your resources, I can leverage your logging to potentially burn more resources.  E.G. if I know you\u0027re writing entire messages to disk every time, I can make the messages as large as possible.  Generally, the issue (and this goes for memory and network approaches as well) is that the disk has a finite capacity, and you can exhaust that and cause writes to start backing up.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the Windows event log, when Windows sees this - it eventually, in some subsystems, starts logging \"the previous event repeats 100 times.\"\r\n\r\nIf you look at ASP.NET Health, it did the same thing - before it raised a health event it would wait some period of time, and if you needed it, you could have it batch them down to \"this event repeats a thousand times\" and get one notification instead of a thousand.\r\n\r\nThe issue, in both cases, is it is really hard to deal with a problem with a hub without a reference for the hub, and so once you\u0027re in the standard logging or event infrastructure, your receiving a messgae or event to log, and aren\u0027t able to easily get back to the ASP.NET connection or hub.\r\n\r\nAnd so ASP.NET, nearly everywhere, has some error notification separate from health and logging.\r\n\r\nI can\u0027t today, but if you ping me a couple times, I can provide a deserializer that requires all non-nullable (C# 8 rules) properties to be populated or raises a notification.  If there\u0027s a field that explicitly states it can be null, I wouldn\u0027t enforce it being set (makes for smaller messages).",

We will re-evaluate this issue, during our next planning meeting(s). \nIf we later determine, that the issue has no community involvement, or it\u0027s very rare and low-impact issue, we will close it - so that the team can focus on more important and high impact issues.\nTo learn more about what to expect next and how this issue will be handled you can read more about our triage process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/docs/TriageProcess.md).",

What types of errors are customers trying to handle. The main thing here seems to be malformed payloads that stop us from invoking your method. Assuming it\u0027s just the payload and not the outer framing, it should be possible on both server and client to have an error handler that gets called if dispatch fails altogether. It won\u0027t be called if an exception is thrown after dispatch, this is strictly when we can\u0027t never call your handler.\r\n\r\nWe also need to decide if we log when the unhandled error method gets called. Maybe we skip it assuming you might be doing logging in there an therefore it\u0027s handled.",

At that point, I can use System.Reactive, LINQ, etc. to do the rest.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027d be fine, from my perspective, to punt logging to the app if it\u0027s registered a handler.\r\n\r\nAnother way to structure it would be a reactive extensions point - but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a good dependency to take.  But that\u0027d allow roughly:\r\n   myHub.Exceptions.Where(condition).Threshold(100, 1000).Each(reportingFunc);\r\n\r\nI believe this needs to be supported on both the server and the client.\r\n\r\nArgument for server:\r\nIf I have a client or a group of clients connecting to me and sending me bad data, I am burning network and CPU. If I have authentication - say a bearer token - being used in a DDOS, the app server alone is in a position to definitively know the bad credential and sever the access.  Especially with console or file-based logs that may contain carriage returns, line feeds, etc. embedded in them it is unreasonable to expect higher level software or hardware to identify and block the connection.  The application on the server alone is positioned to reliably revoke a JWT or similar credential.\r\n\r\nArgument for client:\r\nI have a peer on Android and a peer on the Microsoft Store both talking to each other across a Hub.  I control the version of the Hub, but once I submit a change to Microsoft and Google, I don\u0027t necessarily control that review process.  End user devices won\u0027t download the update until they see wifi. I make a change to the app that results in an exception on down-level versions.  And so the app appears to be launched and running on the user\u0027s device, but nothing at all is happening.  The user\u0027s access to logs is hampered because they\u0027re buried deep on both these OSes.\r\n\r\nArgument for web browser clients:\r\nThis impacts JavaScript clients as well, but to a lesser extent - primarily when fields that were primitive are moved to using structures and a CDN is at play, but a few other cases as well.  It\u0027s less of a problem for a Microsoft or a Facebook, more of a problem for smaller teams.  There tends to be a (wrong) thought that JSON and JavaScript\u0027s object solves all these problems, when in fact - it is the same as GWBASIC or Visual Basic with Option Strict off, and just pushes the Error 5, 7, 9 or 13 to runtime instead.  F12 tools can be disabled, and so console logging isn\u0027t necessarily available when there\u0027s an issue.",

We have to consider a few things\r\n\r\n* Which clients *can* support it?\r\n* Which client environments can support it (for example, AOT environments like Unity wouldn\u0027t be able to support reflection emit-based generation)?\r\n* What\u0027s the API\r\n* How does this interact with client-side hubs #5278\r\n\r\nOriginal issue follows\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the server side, we can create a strongly-typed hub (docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/hubs?view=aspnetcore-3.0#strongly-typed-hubs). However, on the client-side, everything is still loosely typed, which means we lose type safety. Does the TypeScript client have any support for a strongly-typed connection? I imagine it could use generics on the `build` function, eg:\r\n```\r\nconst connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n  .withUrl(\"/hub\")\r\n  .build\u003cMyHub\u003e();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy ideal setup would be automatically generating a TypeScript client based on the C# strongly-typed Hub, but for now I\u0027d be fine just manually creating a TypeScript type that replicates the server-side one.",

A default value would have to be returned in these cases which is a bit ugly.\r\n- As mentioned above, this uses `IL.Emit` so it will not work on all platforms\r\n- Cancellation token support would need to create a proxy for each call\r\n  - Example usage: `hub.InvokeWithCancellation(ct).Echo(\"Message\")`\r\n- Reflection is needed to operate around the `TaskCompletionSource`\r\n\r\nOf course, if this were the taken approach, it would need some more attention, hub attributes would need to be respected and the dependency on `Castle.Core` would need to be removed.",

With new AspNetCore.SignalR it cannot, so the code maintainability is poor.

I don\u0027t have a WASM case to test it on but if you try the `0.2` preview from nuget and find issues, I\u0027d be happy to take a peek.\r\n\r\nI might investigate a third option (source generators) which I could see getting contributed to `dotnet/aspnetcore` eventually.",

The interfaces live in a common project so the SignalR hubs implement them as well. I like this better than generating from a hub class because the interface can be defined independently and consumers don\u0027t have to take a direct dependency on anything strictly tied to a particular server or client implementation.\r\n\r\n\u003e CancellationToken on the client side calls, should it just be CancellationToken = default or generate 2 methods each?\r\n\r\nI\u0027d say this is tied to whether we return the same interface supplied by the user (e.g. `TIntf AsStronglyTypedHub\u003cTIntf\u003e(this HubConnection conn)`) or an extended type (e.g. `ExtendedTIntf AsStronglyTypedHub\u003cTIntf\u003e(this HubConnection conn)`). If both client and server share an interface and we return that interface, then we should respect the interface as defined.\r\n\r\nGiven an interface:\r\n```csharp\r\n    public interface IMockHub\r\n    {\r\n        Task\u003cChannelReader\u003cint\u003e\u003e StreamToClientViaChannel(List\u003cint\u003e a);\r\n\r\n        Task\u003cChannelReader\u003cint\u003e\u003e StreamToClientViaChannelWithToken(List\u003cint\u003e a, CancellationToken cancellationToken);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI currently generate:\r\n```csharp\r\n    public sealed class GeneratedIMockHub : IMockHub\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.HubConnection conn;\r\n        public GeneratedIMockHub(Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.HubConnection connection)\r\n        {\r\n            this.conn = connection;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public System.Threading.Tasks.Task\u003cSystem.Threading.Channels.ChannelReader\u003cint\u003e\u003e StreamToClientViaChannel(System.Collections.Generic.List\u003cint\u003e a)\r\n        {\r\n            return this.conn.StreamAsChannelAsync\u003cint\u003e(\"StreamToClientViaChannel\", a);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public System.Threading.Tasks.Task\u003cSystem.Threading.Channels.ChannelReader\u003cint\u003e\u003e StreamToClientViaChannelWithToken(System.Collections.Generic.List\u003cint\u003e a, System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n        {\r\n            return this.conn.StreamAsChannelAsync\u003cint\u003e(\"StreamToClientViaChannelWithToken\", a, cancellationToken);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs such generating alternate methods is not too hard. However I currently return the same interface provided by the user so such alternate methods couldn\u0027t be exposed to the user. I think this makes it simpler for the user conceptually since they don\u0027t need to know about a custom type generated by us.\r\n\r\nIf we are generating from a hub class or returning an extended type, then yes we can take some creative freedoms..\r\n\r\n\u003e On handlers\r\n\r\nHandlers don\u0027t require anything beyond simple reflection to register callbacks with the `HubConnection` object. An interface is not even necessary. Though without a shared interface, you risk registering callbacks that you may not have intended to be callbacks or mismatch what the server expects due to a typo.\r\n\r\n\u003e Should there be an interface for these and then if you want to provide an implementation for a specific one you can?\r\n\r\nMy current solution allows you to provide just an implementation (it is then assumed that all public methods are callbacks) or an interface plus an implementation (subset defined by the interface are callbacks). I think this works well because the client could independently define an interface (if one isn\u0027t supplied by server), capturing only the callbacks they care about. I called these handlers \"Spokes\" (spoke and hub??), in hindsight I admit it wasn\u0027t the best name.. The most verbose signature I\u0027ve is: `SpokeRegistration RegisterSpoke\u003cTSpokeIntf, TSpokeImpl\u003e(this HubConnection conn, TSpokeImpl spoke)` where `SpokeRegistration` is an `IDisposable` so the callback registrations can be undone later.\r\n\r\n\u003e Should you just register a whole implementation class for all callbacks?\r\n\r\nI think there is value in being able to register multiple implementations so different classes could capture different pieces. This does open the door to overlapping surfaces but could potentially be detected by analyzers.\r\n\r\n\u003e Should the API be part of the builder pattern or something you do after HubConnectionBuilder.Build\r\n\r\nI haven\u0027t taken much look in the builder code but if the underlying `HubConnection` is exposed, then it would be easy to do it from builder as well. I originally wrote my own builder but later changed approach to providing extensions methods on `HubConnection` (for both acquiring a strongly typed hub proxy as well as registering handlers) because I figured (1) that would be the simplest approach for a third party package and (2) it still allowed the underlying `HubConnection` to be freely used by the user where the library didn\u0027t cover all cases and didn\u0027t need to worry about how the user got the `HubConnection`.\r\n",

As soon as you have Azure SignalR or Redis in place, there is no one list of group members.\r\n\r\n\u003e It would be really useful to have an `And` like operator on groups where you can send a message to clients in a number of groups: user intersection in groups.\r\n\r\nWe never had this in ASP.NET SignalR (that I\u0027m aware of). Generally the pattern we recommended was for you to create intersection groups yourself if you need them. Adding new \"addresses\" like this is quite costly since it requires updates and support across scale-out systems (Redis and Azure SignalR).\r\n\r\nIn particularly, this one is challenging because we implement groups using Redis channels and there\u0027s no way to do intersection there. We\u0027d have to implement intersection on each server, which is costly.\r\n\r\nGiven the history here, I don\u0027t think this is a high priority for us, at least not without more customer feedback.",

        "body":  "The idea here is to build a new transport based on HTTP streaming. The idea is for the client to establish **two** long-running HTTP requests. Termination of either request by either party tears down the whole connection (and terminates the other request). This transport is designed for HTTP/2 environments, and the transport would likely be designed to function only when the requests are actually using HTTP/2.\r\n\r\n* One request serves as the \"upstream\" connection. The client sends the request headers (including auth) and then streams data to the server. The server **does not write any response** to this request until the connection terminates.\r\n\r\n* The other request serves as the \"downstream\" connection. The client sends request headers and an empty body. The server sends a long-running response back and writes data to it as data becomes available. The server concludes the response when the connection is terminated.\r\n\r\n**Why two requests?** We could have a single request with both the client and server streaming request/response data. This is permitted in the HTTP protocol. However, support for this in all platforms (Browser, .NET, Node, Java, etc.) is limited and inconsistent. Doing this two-stream model **doesn\u0027t** stop us from doing a bi-directional transport in the future.\r\n\r\nWith this transport, we can also consider deprecating Server-Sent Events. The SSE transport provides a middle-ground between Long Polling and WebSockets and has served us well but it has limitations:\r\n\r\n* IE still doesn\u0027t support it, so it\u0027s usefulness as a \"downlevel\" transport is limited. The set of browsers that support WebSockets is a superset of the set of browsers that support SSE\r\n* It can be impacted by proxies, though not as badly as WebSockets. We\u0027ve encountered proxies that buffer responses which delays messages and can break connections (if timeouts elapse)\r\n* It is limited to the JSON protocol. SSE is an inherently text-based protocol. It is sensitive to line-breaks, making it difficult to encode binary messages. While Base64 encoding is an option, we haven\u0027t use that and simply avoid using the SSE transport for MessagePack.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWork Items (see note below)\r\n* [ ] https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21105 Update the [Transport Protocols](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/SignalR/docs/specs/TransportProtocols.md) spec to include the new HTTP Streaming transport\r\n* [ ] Implement the HTTP Streaming transport in the .NET Server and Client\r\n* [ ] Implement the HTTP Streaming transport in the JavaScript Client\r\n* [ ] Update documentation on [SignalR Client Features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/client-features?view=aspnetcore-3.1) for 5.0\r\n* [ ] ~https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/20462 Remove ServerSentEvents transport~\r\n\r\nNote: This is something that\u0027s fairly low on our priority list for now and may not make 5.0, so we\u0027ve only created issues to track the initial work (rather than spamming the tracker with a bunch of small issues). As we move forward, we\u0027ll create work items to track the rest of the work.",

Browsers and the .NET framework used to enforce really low per-host concurrent connection limits. Browsers still do enforce low limits for non-WebSocket connections.\r\n\r\nOver time, browsers have gradually increased their WebSocket limits. Now it seems to be [up to 255](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/socket/client_socket_pool_manager.cc#48) concurrent WebSocket connections per host in Chrome and 200 in firefox (based on network.websocket.max-connections in about:config).\r\n\r\nIf a server uses 100 SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS like Kestrel does by default, that\u0027s at most 50 concurrent SignalR \"connections\" using this new streaming transport over HTTP/2. That by itself doesn\u0027t seem so bad, but unlike with WebSockets (which have their own connection pool), hitting this limit could affect \"normal\" requests.\r\n\r\nTangentially, we\u0027ll probably want to use negotiate or something to detect HTTP/2, I doubt we\u0027d want to use this transport if we\u0027re making HTTP/1.1 requests.",

Please describe.\r\nCurrently, the only way to specify the SignalR hub route is specifying in the `MapHub` method like:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.UseEndpoints(endpoints =\u003e\r\n{\r\n  endpoints.MapHub\u003cSomeHub\u003e(\"/someHub\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nI think it could be used some attribute as we use in asp net core controllers `[Route(\"/someHub\")]`, this way it would simplify MapHub method, having more consistency about the place to put the hub route (in this case would be in the Hub class). Also, it would allow us to scan for this route and write some custom documentation (ex: some swagger extension) about signalR hubs.\r\nI know I can write that in my app, but it would be nice to have this built-in and it would be more consistent with aspnetcore controllers, maybe the same attribute could be used as well since signalR is part of aspnetcore now.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n",

Please describe.\r\nThe issue is SignalR server-side relies on the first `PingMessage` to enable the client-side ping check. \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/2ad8121efbdddd46920918bddb9ee67e1c4144a9/src/SignalR/server/Core/src/Internal/DefaultHubDispatcher.cs#L180\r\n\r\nHowever, if the client-side sends out messages constantly and **more frequently** than keep alive, the client never has any chance to send out `PingMessage`, and as a result the server-side ping check never invokes. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/d5cf36acc71fe576541bbb8d694a88815c22c800/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts#L344\r\n\r\nAnd this can cause the issue that when using SSE to connect to the service, although client fails to send to the server when JWT token expiration(401), the connection never closes, like described here https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr/issues/943\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nProvide an option to **explicitly enable** the ping check through `SignalROptions` can solve the issue.\r\n",

        "body":  "**Context:**\r\nHosting an application in a kubernetes environment can sometimes cause the service (with active connections) to be shutdown as autoscaling happens. We have implemented graceful shutdown behaviour for various parts of the application but I see no such feature/possibility for SignalR servers. This causes problems when using the [streaming features](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/streaming?view=aspnetcore-3.1) in SignalR. The Hub interface does offer you a `OnDisconnectedAsync` but as it turns out this is fired after the connection has been closed (by the server itself).\r\n\r\n**Things Tried**\r\nI\u0027ve stepped into the source code with a debugger to find out most is handled in privates/internal classes. Should a complete new implementation be written of a [HubConnectionHandler](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/blob/master/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Core/HubConnectionHandler.cs) that can deal with IApplicationLifetime? Or am I missing something like an injectable class that can deal with this. Or is there an existing SignalR lifetime available?\r\n_Also; Im not sure if the HubFilters that seem to be coming out in a later release would help us with our problem._\r\n\r\n**Question/Idea:**\r\nWe would like to await stream completion (with a max timeout) before the SignalR connection is cut off. Is it possible to interact with the [IApplicationLifetime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.iapplicationlifetime?view=aspnetcore-3.1) or await completion before SignalR [connections are actually closed](https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/blob/master/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Core/HubConnectionHandler.cs#L152)?",

I\u0027d be happy to take any PRs that do this. I think the problem is that it can currently be impossible to tell if the client did disconnect ungracefully or not. To know for sure, we\u0027d have to send an explicit message from the client to server saying it\u0027s gracefully closing the connection.\r\n\r\nThe `CloseMessage` already exists, but it\u0027s currently only sent from the server to the client. We can just repurpose it and also send it from the client to server when the client gracefully disconnects by calling `stop()` or similar. The lack of this message would be enough to know the client disconnected ungracefully if the client started the connection with a high enough `HandshakeRequestMessage.Version`. The `CloseMessage` also supports sending an error message via a property, but it seems silly to suppose a client will reliably be able to send a server a message about it\u0027s connectivity problems.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027d have to make a new protocol version for this, and update all the clients to start sending the `CloseMessage` for graceful shutdown. Not a huge amount of work, but certainly not trivial. Without more customers asking for this, it seems low value since the customer could just update their clients to call `await connection.invoke(\"ClosingGracefully\");` before calling `await connection.stop()` and get the same effect. You could just assume any call to `OnDisconnectedAsync` without a call to `ClosingGracefully` first was ungraceful.",

This doesn\u0027t require a protocol change, it\u0027s all server side.\r\n\r\n👍 I didn\u0027t realize we weren\u0027t passing in an exception in that case. Not doing so just seems like a bug.\r\n\r\n\u003e I think this is what I\u0027m after. The previous version of SignalR (for ASP.NET Framework) had an isTimeout parameter on the OnDisconnect method which I presume was set to true in cases like you described. I\u0027m just after that same functionality.\r\n\r\nI believe you\u0027re referring to the `stopCalled` parameter: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/guide-to-the-api/hubs-api-guide-server#how-to-handle-connection-lifetime-events-in-the-hub-class\r\n\r\nThe previous version of SignalR could do this more reliably because clients would call an `/abort` endpoint when gracefully disconnecting (yes \"abort\" was definitely a misnomer here 😆). The previous version of SignalR also didn\u0027t assume a TCP connection closing meant the end of the connection like SignalR Core does. All transports were basically like Core\u0027s long polling transport where the server would have to wait after the client\u0027s last TCP connection closed to see if the client would reconnect with a new TCP connection if `/abort` wasn\u0027t called, so a timeout was effectively the *only* way for a SignalR client could disconnect ungracefully. Even a connection reset didn\u0027t necessarily mean the logical SignalR connection was closing.\r\n\r\nSo, if the `/abort` endpoint wasn\u0027t called before a timeout, old SignalR could assume the client disconnect ungracefully. But if the `/abort` endpoint was called, old SignalR could fire `OnDisconnected(stopCalled: true)` immediately. This `/abort` endpoint in old SignalR serves the exact same purpose as the proposed client-to-server close message in SignalR Core. This was particularly important with the pervious version of SignalR because it worked without sticky sessions, so `OnDisconnect` could fire when a client just \"hopped\" to another server.",

On the other hand, if a user loses connection, the session should be left open for a short period so that if the user is able to reestablish a connection before they time out after 35 seconds, the session can continue. \r\n\r\nI don\u0027t think the suggested `await connection.invoke(\"ClosingGracefully\");` solution works in the scenario where the client disconnects due to closing the browser tab. IIRC, old SignalR managed to have stopCalled be true in this situation, but I can\u0027t think of a way to replicate this by manually sending messages to the server. My testing found that sending in a beforeunload handler doesn\u0027t work seemlessly or reliably cross-browser. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, if you have any other ideas about how I could reliably differentiate between timeouts vs closed browser tab, I\u0027m all ears!",

So, we had to move our SignalR app to a non-clustered Redis cache apart from all the others using the Redis cluster (which is not a great way to scale and is not cost-effective). So, I\u0027m very interested in learning what your findings (and solution) on this will be. Subscribing...",

It restricts the propagation of message to be within the shard of a cluster. Hence, the amount of data passing through the cluster bus is limited in comparison to global Pub/Sub where each message propagates to each node in the cluster. This allows users to horizontally scale the Pub/Sub usage by adding more shards.\r\n\r\nSo these new Redis commands help performance, but that doesn\u0027t mean Sharding will not work with SignalR today.",

The problem is with `StopAsync` method of the `HubConnection` class of the SignalR Core .NET client. After migrating to version 5.0.0 of the client it takes several seconds for the method to complete (between 5 and 10 seconds). In order to not wait several seconds we make a fire-and-forget workaround:\r\n```c#\r\nTask.Run(async () =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    // This try catch is in any case in order to not have any unhandled exception while stopping the connection.\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            await _hubConnection.StopAsync();\r\n        }\r\n        finally\r\n        {\r\n            await _hubConnection.DisposeAsync();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    catch\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nDo you know if this workaround could lead to some open connections left? And is this planned to be fixed soon?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

        "body":  "### Problem Description\r\nAs pointed out by [issue 18074](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18074), references to `MessagePack` are in lock step with ASP.NET Core 3.x and ASP.NET 5.  Consumers that want to use `MessagePack` for their own application use and also use `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.StackExchangeRedis` are forced to the same major version of `MessagePack`.  This also means that upgrading to .NET 5 is more challenging for those projects because they may not be ready to perform a major version upgrade of `MessagePack`.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\nI\u0027d like to see  `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.StackExchangeRedis` depend on an abstraction for the message encoder used for Redis pub/sub.  That would allow us to make adapters to have any version of the SignalR library work with any version of `MessagePack`.  (Similar to how ASP.NET made an abstraction for the json serializer)\r\n",

We have implement as shown below but need clarification on:\r\n\r\n1. If we need to specify with Rx scheduler to use for subscriptions and observations\r\n2. What thread will the onClosed callbacks be called on. From what we see, it is run on the OkHttp thread.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nWe have implemented the library but subscribing `start(), invoke() and stop()` on the `Schedulers.io()` while observing on `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` where needed. Not sure if this is correct or even needed but it was done to ensure network activity is performed on a background thread.\r\n\r\nThe above also lets us ensure that our logic runs on the Main thread but the `onClosed` callback still runs on the `OkHttp thread.\r\n\r\n```\r\nonClosed { e -\u003e\r\n                    if (e == null) {\r\n                        LogUtils.d(TAG, \"Connection closed\")\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        LogUtils.logMessageAndReportException(\r\n                            TAG,\r\n                            \"createHubConnection()\",\r\n                            \"Connection closed\",\r\n                            e\r\n                        )\r\n                    }\r\n                    LogUtils.d(TAG, \"Current thread: ${Thread.currentThread()}\")\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nprints out `Current thread: Thread[OkHttp https://platform-sr.service.signalr.net/...,5,main]`\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- Java Client 5.0.3\r\n- Android Studio 4.1.2\r\n",

Currently they are logged as debug. So i have no chance on the server-side to detect, if an api is calling invalid methods. Except enabling debug-logging for \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR\".\r\n\r\nIn Version 1.1 the DefaultHubDispatcher was public, so it was possible to override and replace it. With .net 5 the Dispatcher is now internal and it is no longer possible to override it.\r\nFurther on i found no possibilty to inject a custom logging logic. Do i miss something?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nThe easiest and fastest way would be to set DefaultHubDispatcher back to public. A maybe better fix would be to allow a custom error handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body":  "### Describe the bug\r\nI\u0027m facing an issue with SignalR. Our benchmark shows that json protocol is faster than messagepack when transfering a lot of data.\r\nWe need to investigate why messagepack isn\u0027t getting the same or better performance than json.\r\n\r\nWhile signalR with json protocol bandwidth increases when using larger packets (following the performance of raw binary websocket implementation), signalR with messagepack seems to be capped.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82504943/114687679-4952c500-9d14-11eb-9880-a5edac42da18.png)\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nUse the following code:\r\nhttps://github.com/Foxstream/SignalrMessagepackExample\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\nIt is a .NET 5.0 project with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client 5.0.5` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Protocols.MessagePack 5.0.5` packages.\r\nRunning on Windows 10 20H2. It uses websocket transport protocol and HTTP.sys.\r\n\r\nUsing the .NET or the Javascript signalR client doesn\u0027t seem to matter because it will result in similar performance issues.\r\n\r\n#### Results on localhost\r\n```\r\nWith messagepack (2000 packets of 256KB)\r\n179 packets/s | Bandwidth=45938 KB/s\r\nIt took 11.14s\r\n\r\nWith json (2000 packets of 256KB)\r\n343 packets/s | Bandwidth=87885 KB/s\r\nIt took 5.82s\r\n```\r\n",

        "body":  "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to provide end-to-end strong typing for all interactions between SignalR clients and SignalR hubs.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\n- Currently, SignalR clients can neither make strongly-typed calls to a SignalR hub nor register handlers for server-to-client calls in a strongly-typed manner. As such, developers are forced to write magic strings as well as guess argument sequence and return type.\r\n- [Community has asked for](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/15198) [this over the years](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/5278) and [people had to](https://github.com/ocbaker/SignalRNetClientProxyMap) [implement their](https://github.com/JasonEdb/SignalR.TypedClient) [own workarounds](https://github.com/MarkNickeson/SignalrCoreClientSideProxies) [including mine](https://github.com/mehmetakbulut/SignalR.Strong).\r\n- With end-to-end strong typing:\r\n    - Many run-time errors will be caught as build-time errors.\r\n    - Refactoring solutions that has both client and server projects will be easier since both ends can now share an actual interface.\r\n\r\n## In scope\r\n\r\n1. Strongly-typed remote procedure calls from a SignalR client to a SignalR hub\r\n2. Strongly-typed streaming calls from a SignalR client to a SignalR hub\r\n    1. Support for both single direction streaming in either direction and bi-directional streaming\r\n    2. Support for cancellation token in streaming calls.\r\n    3. Support for both `ChannelReader\u003c\u003e` and `IAsyncEnumerable\u003c\u003e` as the underlying stream\r\n3. Strongly-typed handlers for calls from a SignalR hub to a SignalR client\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\n\r\n1. Non-C# usage. For the time being, we should focus on design and implementation of the ideal solution. Later we can think about how this design can be implemented in languages other than C# based on collaboration with the community.\r\n\r\n## Risks / unknowns\r\n\r\n1. Transformative features (e.g. `HubMethodName`) can break strongly-typed clients depending on the particular implementation.\r\n    1. Should we allow interface definitions to be annotated with attributes so the consumers can account for a subset of these issues?\r\n2. Different implementations have different performance.\r\n    1. Is there a level of performance that we would want to guarantee across all target platforms?\r\n3. Some designs may not be possible to implement for some platforms.\r\n    1. Which platforms should we target?\r\n    2. Would we be OK with different implementations for different platforms?\r\n4. Versioning may be hard.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Client to Server Calls\r\n\r\nLet\u0027s say there is an interface `IMyHub` as defined below which is implemented by an ASP.NET Core application as `MyHub : SignalR.Hub, IMyHub`.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    public interface IMyHub\r\n    {\r\n        Task Do();\r\n\r\n        Task\u003cint\u003e Get();\r\n\r\n        Task Set(int a);\r\n        \r\n        Task\u003cint\u003e GetAndSet(int a);\r\n\r\n        Task\u003cChannelReader\u003cint\u003e\u003e StreamToClientViaChannel();\r\n\r\n        Task\u003cChannelReader\u003cint\u003e\u003e StreamToClientViaChannelWithToken(CancellationToken cancellationToken);\r\n\r\n        Task StreamFromClientViaChannel(ChannelReader\u003cint\u003e reader);\r\n\r\n        IAsyncEnumerable\u003cint\u003e StreamToClientViaEnumerableWithToken([EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken);\r\n\r\n        Task StreamFromClientViaEnumerable(IAsyncEnumerable\u003cint\u003e reader);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA developer currently needs to consume it as below.\r\n```csharp\r\nawait hubConnection.InvokeAsync(\"Do\");\r\nvar ret = (int) await hubConnection.SendAsync(\"GetAndSet\", 100);\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, developer could be making strongly-typed calls.\r\n```csharp\r\nawait myHub.Do();\r\nvar ret = await myHub.GetAndSet(100);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can either have such a proxy be acquired from a hub connection or a builder.\r\n```csharp\r\nvar myHub = myHubConnection.AsHubProxy\u003cIMyHub\u003e();\r\n// vs\r\nvar myHub = new HubProxyBuilder\u003cIMyHub\u003e()\r\n    .WithConnection(myHubConnection)\r\n    .ConfigureAnythingElse()\r\n    .Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAcquisiton from a hub connection is simpler while builder provides more room for extension in future.\r\n\r\n### Server to Client Call Handlers\r\n\r\nOne can similarly define an interface `IMyClient` as below which can then be used in `Hub\u003cIMyClient\u003e` on server-end and implemented by any consumer to provide callbacks.\r\n```csharp\r\n    public interface IMyClient\r\n    {\r\n        void Callback1();\r\n        void Callback2(string arg);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA developer currently needs to provide such callbacks as below.\r\n```csharp\r\nawait hubConnection.On(\"Callback1\", (req) =\u003e { someActivity1(); });\r\nawait hubConnection.On\u003cstring\u003e(\"Callback2\", (arg) =\u003e { someActivity2(arg); });\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, developer could be registering callback in a strongly-typed manner.\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyClient : IMyClient { .. }\r\nvar myClient = new MyClient();\r\nawait hubConnection.RegisterCallbacks\u003cIMyClient\u003e(myClient);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple callback providers can be registered against the same hub connection so different callbacks can be provided by different classes. However this does mean overlap is possible. We\u0027d want to decide how to handle this and whether to impose restrictions.\r\n\r\n## Detailed design\r\n\r\nTo be decided.\r\n\r\nSome alternatives for client-to-server call implementation are:\r\n**Source-generated proxies** utilizes C# 9 / .NET 5 source generator feature.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Supported on JIT and AOT platforms\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Consumer must be a C# 9 / .NET 5 project (though indirect consumption may be possible)\r\n\r\n**Dynamic proxies** utilizes `Reflection.Emit` to dynamically generate proxy.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Consumer can be a .NET Standard 2.0 project\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Not supported on AOT platforms\r\n- [Third-party dependency](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/dynamicproxy/) is needed if we don\u0027t want to reimplement a lot of proxy generation code or introduce significant constraints.\r\n\r\n**Expressive proxies** utilizes expressions to emulate a strongly-typed user experience.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Mostly universal platform support\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Slowest\r\n- More verbose usage (e.g. `await hubConnection.AsExpressive\u003cIMyHub\u003e().InvokeAsync(hub =\u003e hub.Do())`)\r\n\r\nServer-to-client calls can be registered with just reflection (no `Reflection.Emit`) which is simple enough and would work on practically any platform. Other alternatives are possible such as source generation as well.",

However this does mean overlap is possible. We\u0027d want to decide how to handle this and whether to impose restrictions.\r\n\r\nMy main issue with this approach is that you are forced to define all methods on the client side. We\u0027ve seen many cases where some clients don\u0027t register for all methods. And you can\u0027t just have them throw `NotImplementedException` because that isn\u0027t a good design and the SignalR library will just swallow that (we probably log as well).\r\n\r\n\u003eclient-to-server call implementation are:\r\n\r\nSource-generated proxies is my favorite. It should work everywhere (in some environments you might need to generate the code before using it but that shouldn\u0027t be too hard).\r\n\r\n\u003e Transformative features (e.g. `HubMethodName`) can break strongly-typed clients depending on the particular implementation.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e     1. Should we allow interface definitions to be annotated with attributes so the consumers can account for a subset of these issues?\r\n\r\nI\u0027d say this is a P2 concern. We don\u0027t support this today, but if we add support for it, then we\u0027ll update the proxy to handle it as well.\r\n\r\n\u003e Different implementations have different performance.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e     1. Is there a level of performance that we would want to guarantee across all target platforms?\r\n\r\nAs fast as possible 😄 Ideally there shouldn\u0027t be very much observable perf difference with this. Most of the code will be a pass-through wrapper right?\r\n\r\n\u003e Some designs may not be possible to implement for some platforms.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e     1. Which platforms should we target?\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e     2. Would we be OK with different implementations for different platforms?\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t think a different implementation for different platforms is good. We already feel the burden for that sort of thing by having different clients for different languages. And it looks like we\u0027ll already be needing a different proxy generation for .NET vs. Typescript.\r\n\r\nWe should be targeting everything .NET Core runs on. i.e Xamarin, WPF, Console, WASM, etc.\r\n\r\n\u003e     4\\. Versioning may be hard.\r\n\r\nWhat versioning are you envisioning? So far we haven\u0027t made any breaking changes to the protocol or main APIs and aren\u0027t planning on doing that. New APIs will not be used by old proxy generators which should be fine. Although if possible we can try to make new proxy generation work on older clients.\r\n\r\n\u003e ```cs\r\n\u003e var myHub = myHubConnection.AsHubProxy\u003cIMyHub\u003e();\r\n\u003e // vs\r\n\u003e var myHub = new HubProxyBuilder\u003cIMyHub\u003e()\r\n\u003e     .WithConnection(myHubConnection)\r\n\u003e     .ConfigureAnythingElse()\r\n\u003e     .Build();\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\r\nI currently like the first option as it allows use of both the strongly typed connection, as well as the less-typed connection. Although I guess the type returned from the builder could include a property with the less-typed connection.",

                                           "body":  "# Another proposal\r\n\r\nI have published a library called [\"TypedSignalR.Client\"](https://github.com/nenoNaninu/TypedSignalR.Client) which is Source Generator to create a strongly typed SignalR Client.  So this proposal has an implementation(slightly different from here). \r\n\r\nI think my proposal can address some of the current requirements.\r\n- No breaking changes.\r\n- We don\u0027t have to define all methods. \r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThe work flow for developers is as follows.\r\n\r\n1. Annotate Attribute to generate code.\r\n2. Inherit the generated class and override only the necessary methods to implement. \r\n3. Call Hub through the implemented class. \r\n\r\n# Detail and Example\r\n\r\nFirst, suppose we have the following interface or class definition. This interface and class definition are assumed to be shared in the server and client projects by project reference etc. \r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic class UserDefine\r\n{\r\n    public Guid RandomId { get; set; }\r\n    public DateTime Datetime { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// The return type of the client-side method must be Task. \r\n// This is because Hub\u003cT\u003e will cause a runtime error if a non-Task type is returned.\r\npublic interface IClientContract\r\n{\r\n    // Of course, user defined type is OK. \r\n    Task SomeClientMethod1(string user, string message, UserDefine userDefine);\r\n    Task SomeClientMethod2();\r\n}\r\n\r\n// The return type of the method on the hub-side must be Task or Task \u003cT\u003e. \r\npublic interface IHubContract\r\n{\r\n    Task\u003cstring\u003e SomeHubMethod1(string user, string message);\r\n    Task SomeHubMethod2();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd suppose that it is implemented on the server as follows. \r\n\r\n```cs\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;\r\n\r\npublic class SomeHub : Hub\u003cIClientContract\u003e, IHubContract\r\n{\r\n    public async Task\u003cstring\u003e SomeHubMethod1(string user, string message)\r\n    {\r\n        await this.Clients.All.SomeClientMethod1(user, message, new UserDefineClass());\r\n        return \"OK!\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public async Task SomeHubMethod2()\r\n    {\r\n        await this.Clients.Caller.SomeClientMethod2();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnder these assumptions, on the client side, annotate the `HubClientBaseAttribute` to the partial class as follows.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nusing TypedSignalR.Client;\r\n\r\n[HubClientBase(typeof(IHubContract), typeof(IClientContract))]\r\npartial class ClientBase\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy annotating the HubClientBaseAttribute, the following code will be generated (simplified here).\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npartial abstract class ClientBase : IHubClient\u003cIHubContract\u003e, IClientContract, IAsyncDisposable\r\n{\r\n    private class HubInvoker : IHubContract\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly HubConnection _connection;\r\n\r\n        public HubInvoker(HubConnection connection)\r\n        {\r\n            _connection = connection;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Task\u003cstring\u003e SomeHubMethod1(string user,string message)\r\n        {\r\n            return _connection.InvokeAsync\u003cstring\u003e(nameof(SomeHubMethod1), user, message);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Task SomeHubMethod2()\r\n        {\r\n            return _connection.InvokeAsync(nameof(SomeHubMethod2));\r\n        }\r\n    } // class HubInvoker\r\n\r\n    public HubConnection Connection { get; }\r\n    public IHubContract Hub { get; }\r\n    protected List\u003cIDisposable\u003e disposableList = new();\r\n\r\n    public ClientBase(HubConnection connection)\r\n    {\r\n        Connection = connection;\r\n        Hub = new HubInvoker(connection);\r\n\r\n        Connection.Closed += OnClosed;\r\n        Connection.Reconnected += OnReconnected;\r\n        Connection.Reconnecting += OnReconnecting;\r\n\r\n        var d1 = Connection.On\u003cstring, string, UserDefineClass\u003e(nameof(SomeClientMethod1), SomeClientMethod1);\r\n        var d2 = Connection.On(nameof(SomeClientMethod2), SomeClientMethod2);\r\n\r\n        disposableList.Add(d1);\r\n        disposableList.Add(d2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public virtual Task SomeClientMethod1(string user,string message, UserDefineClass userDefine) =\u003e Task.CompletedTask;\r\n\r\n    public virtual Task SomeClientMethod2() =\u003e Task.CompletedTask;\r\n\r\n    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        Connection.Closed -= OnClosed;\r\n        Connection.Reconnected -= OnReconnected;\r\n        Connection.Reconnecting -= OnReconnecting;\r\n\r\n        await Connection.DisposeAsync();\r\n\r\n        foreach(var d in disposableList)\r\n        {\r\n            d.Dispose();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public virtual Task OnClosed(Exception e) =\u003e Task.CompletedTask;\r\n    public virtual Task OnReconnected(string connectionId) =\u003e Task.CompletedTask;\r\n    public virtual Task OnReconnecting(Exception e) =\u003e Task.CompletedTask;\r\n} // class ClientBase\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe generated code is inherited and used. The usability is very similar to the case of inheriting `Hub\u003cT\u003e`.\r\n\r\n- Hub to Client : `this.Clients.All.SomeClientMethod()`\r\n- Client to Hub : `this.Hub.SomeHubMethod()`\r\n\r\nAlso, the definition of the function is not a callback, but writing feeling similar to Hub-side. \r\n\r\n```cs\r\nclass HubClient : ClientBase\r\n{\r\n    public HubClient(HubConnection connection, string arg) : base(connection)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // override and impl\r\n    public override async Task SomeClientMethod1(string user, string message, UserDefineClass userDefine)\r\n    {\r\n        await this.Hub.SomeHubMethod1(string user, string message);\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Call SomeClientMethod1!\");\r\n        return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // We don\u0027t have to implement all the methods !\r\n    // public override Task SomeClientMethod2()\r\n\r\n    // I think it is very comfortable to write SignalR event as follows.\r\n    public override Task OnClosed(Exception e)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine($\"[On Closed!]\");\r\n        return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Of course, we don\u0027t have to define all events.\r\n    // public override Task OnReconnecting(Exception e)\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nSince the base class comes with an implementation, developers can selectively override it, not all functions need to be implemented. \r\n\r\nIt\u0027s also easy to use. \r\n\r\n```cs\r\nHubConnection connection = ...;\r\n\r\nvar client = new HubClient(connection, \"some parameter\");\r\n\r\nawait client.Connection.StartAsync();\r\n\r\n// Invoke hub methods\r\nvar response = await client.Hub.SomeHubMethod1(\"user\", \"message\");\r\nConsole.WriteLine(response);\r\n\r\nawait client.Connection.StopAsync();\r\nawait client.DisposeAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don\u0027t hete writing `new HubClient(connection, \"some parameter\")`.  If you are not comfortable with this, how about the following API?\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic static T Build\u003cT\u003e(this IHubConnectionBuilder source, Func\u003cHubConnection,T\u003e factoryMethod)\r\n{\r\n    HubConnection connection = source.Build();\r\n    return factory.Invoke(connection);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n    var client = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n        .WithUrl(\"https://~~~\")\r\n        .Build(connection =\u003e new HubClient(connection, \"some parameter\"));\r\n}\r\n```",

For some reason I was thinking there would be a difference. We probably don\u0027t want that. It would be interesting if there was a more strongly-typed API like, `hubProxy.MethodName.Register((param) =\u003e Console.WriteLine(param));` food for thought. But I do think we should not have `RegisterCallback` in it\u0027s current state since it adds nothing over `.On`.\r\n\r\n\u003epublic IDisposable RegisterCallbackProvider\u003cTInterface, TImplementation\u003e(this HubConnection conn, TImplementation callbackProvider) where TImplementation : TInterface;\r\n\r\nShould this be taking the `HubConnection` or the proxy type? And if it\u0027s on the proxy type, it wouldn\u0027t need to be an extension method, and the `TInterface` could be pre-defined based on the `GetProxy` call earlier.\r\n\r\n\u003epublic T GetProxy\u003cT\u003e(this HubConnection conn);\r\n\r\nThis should return the proxy type right?

                                           "body":  "Here is a more concrete proxy example. Given following interface in a shared/common project/library:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface IMyHub\r\n{\r\n    Task DoSomething();\r\n    Task\u003cint\u003e DoSomethingElse(float arg);\r\n    IAsyncEnumerable\u003cint\u003e StreamBidirectional(IAsyncEnumerable\u003cfloat\u003e clientToServer, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken token);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated proxy would be: (types would be written in fully qualified form but just simplifying for showing..)\r\n```csharp\r\npublic sealed class GeneratedIMyHub : IMyHub\r\n{\r\n    private readonly HubConnection conn;\r\n    public GeneratedIMyHub(HubConnection connection)\r\n    {\r\n        this.conn = connection;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public Task DoSomething()\r\n    {\r\n        return this.conn.InvokeAsync(\"DoSomething\");\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public Task\u003cint\u003e DoSomethingElse(float arg)\r\n    {\r\n        return this.conn.InvokeAsync\u003cint\u003e(\"DoSomethingElse\", arg);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public IAsyncEnumerable\u003cint\u003e StreamBidirectional(IAsyncEnumerable\u003cfloat\u003e clientToServer, CancellationToken token)\r\n    {\r\n        return this.conn.StreamAsync\u003cint\u003e(\"StreamBidrectional\", clientToServer, token);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMethods with `void` rtype are the only caveat. These would be called via `SendAsync` but that returns a task so we have to ignore or discard the returned task.\r\n\r\n`GeneratedIMyHub` is an implementation detail that is not shown to the user on any API (though they can browse to source if they want). When the user calls `hubConnection.GetProxy\u003cIMyHub\u003e()`, they just get an object that satisfies `IMyHub` which happens to really be of type `GeneratedIMyHub`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003e Should this be taking the HubConnection or the proxy type?\r\n\r\n`RegisterCallbackProvider` should indeed take the `HubConnection` object and not the proxy type or the proxy object. This is because the callbacks aren\u0027t related to the strongly-typed representation of the hub. `TInterface` here would nominally be a `IMyClient` published/shared by server in a common project/library. In my opinion, we shouldn\u0027t tie this to `IMyHub` which is implemented by proxy as well as the actual hub.\r\n\r\nIn the case of `RegisterCallbackProvider`, you can imagine two variants:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic IDisposable RegisterCallbackProvider\u003cTInterface, TImplementation\u003e(this HubConnection conn, TImplementation callbackProvider) where TImplementation : TInterface;\r\n\r\npublic IDisposable RegisterCallbackProvider\u003cTClient\u003e(this HubConnection conn, TClient callbackProvider);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnderlying code would look like:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic IDisposable RegisterCallbackProvider\u003cTInterface, TImplementation\u003e(this HubConnection conn, TImplementation callbackProvider) where TImplementation : TInterface\r\n{\r\n    var intfType = typeof(TInterface);\r\n    var regs = new List\u003cIDisposable\u003e();\r\n    var methods = intfType.GetMethods(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public);\r\n    foreach (var method in methods)\r\n    {\r\n        var reg = conn.On(method.Name, method.GetParameters().Select(a =\u003e a.ParameterType).ToArray(),\r\n                objects =\u003e\r\n                    {\r\n                        method.Invoke(spoke, objects);\r\n                        return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n                    });\r\n                regs.Add(reg);\r\n    }\r\n    return MakeDisposableOf(regs);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic IDisposable RegisterCallbackProvider\u003cTClient\u003e(this HubConnection conn, TClient callbackProvider)\r\n{\r\n    return RegisterCallbackProvider\u003cTClient, TClient\u003e(conn, callbackProvider);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a more concrete example, we can have the following interface in our shared/common project:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface IMyClient\r\n{\r\n    void SomeCallback(float arg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn client project, user can utilize a callback provider like:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyClient : IMyClient\r\n{\r\n    public void SomeCallback(float arg) { .. }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar registration = hubConnection.RegisterCallbackProvider\u003cIMyClient, MyClient\u003e(new MyClient());\r\n// or hubConnection.RegisterCallbackProvider(new MyClient());\r\nregistration.Dispose();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere aren\u0027t many restrictions on what could be a callback provider. For example, if the user doesn\u0027t have a `IMyClient`, they can still register a provider by using the 2nd overload. That would just use all public instance methods as the \"interface\" so the user would need to ensure they don\u0027t have public methods that aren\u0027t meant to be callable. Though we can restrict registration to always supply an interface (and remove the 2nd overload) if we don\u0027t like this option.",

The backend will almost always be ASP.NET Core, and the frontend is either Blazor or Avalonia (or MAUI or even WinForms if someone still wants to do those).\r\nIn any case we can share a contract DLL =\u003e I want strongly typed in both directions, always. Doing stuff manually is only a potential for an error. If some dynamic logic is required it can still be stringly typed and this library is just not used.\r\n\r\nSame thing about the possibility for reflection: this package is not used in legacy code (because it doesn’t really exist yet) and going forward when there is a source generation option I’d pick it – for better AOT compatibility alone. I can hardly think of a scenario where the amount of code generated for a simple SignalR client would be a concern regarding assembly size. Yet even if that is the case or more flexibility is required, we are still able to stringly type to our heart’s contents.\r\n\r\nI’m sure you have very valid reasons for your current plans, but I wanted to voice my view of preferring less complexity in this case anyway. So, in my opinion supporting only scenario 3 and source generation would be sufficient. But you don’t have to hurry, there are good community solutions out there already =\u003e take your time to find a good canonical solution.\r\n",

MessageReceived;\n    readonly HubConnection _connection;\n\n    public ChatHubClient(HubConnection connection)\n    {\n        _connection = connection;\n        _connection.On\u003cChatMessage\u003e(nameof(IChatClient.ReceiveMessage), ReceiveMessage);\n        // register any additional receivers here with a handler to invoke the corresponding event\n    }\n\n    public HubConnectionState State =\u003e _connection.State;\n    public Task ConnectAsync() =\u003e _connection.StartAsync();\n\n    public Task ReceiveMessage(ChatMessage message)\n    {\n        MessageReceived?.Invoke(message);\n        return Task.CompletedTask;\n    }\n\n    public async Task Broadcast(ChatMessage message)\n        =\u003e await _connection.SendAsync(nameof(IChatHub.Broadcast), message);\n\n    public ValueTask DisposeAsync()\n    {\n        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);\n        return _connection.DisposeAsync();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen the final wiring in the component that consumes the hub\n\n```cs\n// MyComponent.razor.cs\n\n   async Task ConnectAsync()\n   {\n       var cxn = new HubConnectionBuilder()\n           .WithUrl(Navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(\"/chathub\"))\n           .Build();\n       client = new(cxn);\n       client.MessageReceived += (message) =\u003e\n       {\n           messages.Add(message);\n           InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);\n       };\n       await client.ConnectAsync();\n       await InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);\n   }\n\n   async Task Send()\n   {\n       if (client is null \n           || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(messageInput)\n           || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(userInput))\n           return;\n       await client.Broadcast(new ChatMessage(userInput, messageInput));\n       messageInput = \"\";\n   }\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n",

I did test with 2, 3 and 4 but failed to delete obj and bin folders so my testing was polluted. I have no idea why deleting them has any bearing as it is normally not a requirement when upgrading/downgrading NuGet packages, but clearly some kind of state was left behind when jumping between versions in this case. So I am content on preview-1 for now but am locked out from any new updates until this is fixed.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

At least not for supporting code that is **not** shipped part of our SDK (including SignalR).\r\n\r\nIOW in the current (soon legacy) SDK we add linker support for the BCL we ship (as part of the SDK). That can be achieve by different forms, but that\u0027s transparent to developers.\r\n\r\nThe default linker mode for app is \"Link SDK\" which means the linker will **only remove** code from assemblies that we ship.\r\n\r\nIn order for the linker to remove code in \"user code\" (assemblies not part of the SDK) then the linker mode must be set to \"Link all\". That also means the developer becomes responsible of ensuring the code is linker safe, e.g. preserving code accessed thru reflection.\r\n\r\n\u003e Turn on linking (\"Link SDKs only\")\r\n\r\nThat does not seems to be the case here... and it would mean `UnnamedOptionsManager` is not removed. \r\n\r\nWhat _might_ be happening is that the app has code (likely an assembly binary) compiled against \"Assembly 6.0\" (that would include references to `UnnamedOptionsManager`) but builds the app against `Assembly 5.0` (that would *not* have `UnnamedOptionsManager`).\r\n\r\nThat can work for a JIT app, since such errors will happen at runtime, and you might never hit the code path that would throw an exception.\r\n\r\nHowever that often won\u0027t work for AOT (required for iOS) since the error will happen at build time [1]. Same thing for the linker... it won\u0027t be able to resolve the metadata and fail [1]\r\n\r\n[1] unless the code is only used thru reflection... in that case the error will also be at runtime\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However it is, sadly, of little use to diagnose the issue. There\u0027s something _weird_ as the linker would not remove a \"user\" (non SDK) type. In most cases this type of issues involve assemblies binaries that were build against a different version of the dependencies (than the one your app is providing).\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s not much, beside guessing, that can be done without a test case to reproduce the issue. Are you able to attach a test case (ideally a subset of what you have) we can look into ? If you can provide this then I\u0027ll have a look, because I\u0027m curious :-)\r\n\r\nIf not then another (less optimal) way to find what happened is to the build your project doing binary search with different builds, between p1 and p2, to find which commit cause the issue. It can be done with sources, but it\u0027s easier if you have binaries.\r\n\r\n@BrennanConroy does your CI publish every build somewhere @Tommigun1980 can access ?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

See https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/11229.\r\n\r\nIf I look at the `mtouch.exe` on my machine in ILSpy I see the following code:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprotected override bool IsLinkerSafeAttribute(CustomAttribute attribute)\r\n{\r\n\tTypeReference attributeType = attribute.get_AttributeType();\r\n\tstring name = ((MemberReference)attributeType).get_Name();\r\n\tstring text = name;\r\n\tif (!(text == \"LinkerSafeAttribute\"))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (text == \"AssemblyMetadataAttribute\")\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tif (!attribute.get_HasConstructorArguments())\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tif (attributeType.get_Namespace() != \"System.Reflection\")\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tCustomAttributeArgument val = attribute.get_ConstructorArguments().get_Item(0);\r\n\t\t\tif (((CustomAttributeArgument)(ref val)).get_Value() as string!= \"IsTrimmable\")\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tval = attribute.get_ConstructorArguments().get_Item(1);\r\n\t\t\treturn ((CustomAttributeArgument)(ref val)).get_Value().ToString().ToLowerInvariant() == \"true\";\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn false;\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logic is used to tell whether to set the `AssemblyAction.Link` action on the assembly or not.\r\n\r\nHowever, the issue is, the iOS mtouch tool should only be respecting the `IsTrimmable` assembly attribute if it also respects all the other attributes we\u0027ve added to the new version of the linker: `DynamicallyAccessedMembers`, `DynamicDependency`, etc. Just because an assembly has `IsTrimmable` on it, doesn\u0027t mean that it can be trimmed without also respecting these new attributes.\r\n\r\nI believe this issue should be moved to https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios, as the current version of the mtouch tool is not doing the right thing.\r\n\r\ncc @spouliot @sbomer ",

The current list of libraries that don\u0027t plan on supporting trimming in the near future:\r\n\r\n* System.Composition.Convention\r\n* System.ComponentModel.Composition.Registration\r\n* System.Composition.TypedParts\r\n* System.Composition.Hosting\r\n* System.ComponentModel.Composition\r\n* System.CodeDom\r\n* System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager\r\n* System.Speech\r\n\r\nFor those assemblies we don\u0027t add the `IsTrimmable` assembly metadata - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/search?q=SetIsTrimmable\r\n\r\nBut the rest of the assemblies we ship in the .NET 6 timeframe will have `IsTrimmable=true` on them.

Your report may be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core) but ONLY if it is reported through email.\r\nFor other types of questions, consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).\r\n\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nMy project is a Xamarin.Forms iOS/Android app. My project\u0027s shared project is a normal platform independent Xamarin.Forms .NET Standard 2.1 project. Said project is referencing the Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client library.\r\n\r\nThere are several RPC registered to a HubConnection:\r\n```c#\r\nconnection.On(\"SomeRPC\", () =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"HELLO!\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese work flawlessly in all permutations of release configurations except one.\r\n\r\niOS: AOT + LLVM: Works -- RPCs are invoked (i.e. `connection.On` callbacks are invoked).\r\nAndroid: AOT: Works -- RPCs are invoked (i.e. `connection.On` callbacks are invoked).\r\nAndroid AOT + LLVM: **Doesn\u0027t work!** RPCs are never invoked.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\u003c!--\r\nWe ❤ code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a GitHub repo.\r\nFor a repro project, create a new ASP.NET Core project using the template of your your choice, apply the minimum required code to result in the issue you\u0027re observing.\r\n\r\nWe will close this issue if:\r\n- the repro project you share with us is complex. We can\u0027t investigate custom projects, so don\u0027t point us to such, please.\r\n- if we will not be able to repro the behavior you\u0027re reporting\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n1) Set up a Xamarin.Forms application.\r\n2) Add the Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client NuGet to the shared project. Note: Use 6.0.0-preview1 because of this issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/33269\r\n3) Register some `connection.On` RPCs.\r\n4) Use some means to invoke the RPCs (from some test server I guess).\r\n5) *Optional*: Build and run a release build for iOS with AOT + LLVM on to verify that the RPCs are invoked.\r\n6) *Optional*: Build and run a release build for Android with AOT on to verify that the RPCs are invoked.\r\n7) Build and run a release build for Android with AOT + LLVM on to verify that the RPCs are **not** invoked.\r\n\r\n(In the off-chance that Android LLVM builds fail to build, follow the workaround at https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/5764#issuecomment-856062396 until https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/5764 is fixed.)\r\n\r\n_So all in all, turning LLVM on for Android builds makes RPCs not being called anymore. This effectively prevents one from using LLVM on Android until this issue is fixed._\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\u003c!-- \r\nInclude the exception you get when facing this issue\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\nNone. Breakpoints show that the RPCs are not invoked on Android when LLVM is turned on, but there are no exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client version: 6.0.0-preview1\r\n- Xamarin.Forms version: 5.0.0-2012\r\n- VS For Mac version: 8.10.1\r\n",

I am saying that the SignalR client library doesn’t work with the LLVM compiler on Android. It does work with LLVM on iOS. When LLVM is enabled on Android RPC callbacks are not being invoked for some reason.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean with libraries not supporting the linker btw? All libraries I have ever used can be linked, except the past three preview versions of SignalR. When the linker is enabled it links all SDKs and the linker kinda has to be enabled unless you want your app to be impossibly large, it’s not run for certain libraries only. If a library can’t be linked it has some problem that needs to be fixed. There’s no way linker support could not be a priority for vendors. Maybe you are thinking of full program linking, but I am not using it, only SDK linking. Please remember that the SignalR client library is used in Xamarin mobile phone apps as well.\r\n\r\nBut that said, this ticket is not about linkers, that’s in the other ticket. This ticket is about the LLVM problem on Android.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/deploy-test/release-prep describes the LLVM under the section “LLVM Optimizing Compiler”.\r\n\r\nSignalR is recommended for real-time communication in Xamarin apps by Microsoft: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/build-2019-crafting-real-time-mobile-apps-with-xamarin-and-signalr/\r\n\r\nBut apps using SignalR must be able to utilize LLVM if we are to release them to the public. It’s almost certainly a very minor detail that needs to be tweaked as LLVM should work out of the box. I’m sure it won’t take you guys many minutes to fix whatever issue there is.\r\n\r\nIf SignalR is no longer supposed to work in mobile apps then that has not been documented. But for mobile apps to be able to be released, we have to make optimized builds before submitting the apps to the app stores and to customers. Libraries must be mindful of the different environments where they can be used, especially if they are the recommended practices by Microsoft itself. It is extremely time consuming to figure out which library doesn’t play by the rules, especially when you are following all the best practices that Microsoft has laid out. In its most banal form, a lot of sample apps can’t be compiled right now as it stands.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

I\u0027m 80% sure this is the issue, if there\u0027s something else wrong then we\u0027d be happy to fix  but as I said before, we don\u0027t test our libraries in these environments and until .NET 7 we don\u0027t be investing in a linker story outside of what we\u0027re planning to do now.\r\n\r\n\u003e If a library can’t be linked it has some problem that needs to be fixed\r\n\r\nRight, see my previous comment. Making libraries linker friendly has been focus for .NET 6 with Blazor, Xamarin will converge on that same plan in .NET 6. Before then, you just got lucky. Most of the libraries we ship, including SignalR don\u0027t work with the linker and I don\u0027t expect the mass of libraries to work that are on NuGet.\r\n\r\n\u003e I’m sure it won’t take you guys many minutes to fix whatever issue there is.\r\n\r\nWe don\u0027t plan to get to this issue anytime soon, at least during the .NET 6 timeframe. If it\u0027s something that can be easily debugged and you can pinpoint something easy we can fix, we\u0027ll take it, beyond that, we\u0027re not going to take any action here.",

Without this, the client could queue the entire stream at once (via `subject.next(nextData)`) thereby blocking interactivity till the stream was transferred. This would in turn present a breaking change for certain functionality like file uploads. Instead we took a `send`/`invoke` based approach where we `send` `X` chunks, and then `invoke` every `X+1` chunks to get a \"heartbeat\" for the stream, and allow other requests to interrupt the transfer.",

But if the user is already connected, he can still send and receive message. I could add a filter to ignore all request for this user, but he will still be able to receive all the message.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution seem to create a « request disconnect » message in user code.\r\n```\r\n// backend\r\n_hubContext.Clients.User(\"user-id-here\").RequestDisconnect();\r\n\r\n//frontend\r\nconst connection: HubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n  .withUrl(\u0027/hub/myHub\u0027, {\r\n    accessTokenFactory: async () =\u003e (await getAccessToken()) ?? \u0027\u0027,\r\n    transport: HttpTransportType.WebSockets,\r\n    skipNegotiation: true\r\n  })\r\n  .withAutomaticReconnect()\r\n  .build();\r\n\r\nconnection.on(\u0027RequestDisconnect\u0027, () =\u003e {\r\n  connection.stop();\r\n});\r\n```\r\nBut i don\u0027t like that solution, a user could have a client that doesn\u0027t respect the requestDisconnect. The other solution seem to \r\nseem to manually track the user connection in the hub itself and to be able to do a .Abort() on it later:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/5333#issuecomment-564702805\r\n\r\n\u003e There is likely a workaround way to implement this right now.

The request here is to be able to do it from outside the hub.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003eWhile we don\u0027t generally recommend doing this, it is currently OK to capture the HubCallerContext (from the Context property) in OnConnectedAsync, store it somewhere (a dictionary indexed by ConnectionID perhaps) and then call .Abort() on it to terminate the connection.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003eI do agree that we should look at a more first-class way to do this, but I\u0027d be curious if this workaround works for your scenario. Would you be able to try it and report back? We\u0027ll look at this for 5.0, but that\u0027s not coming until November 2020 and I\u0027d like to be able to give you something that works before then :).\r\n\r\nIs that any way that this functionality could be implemented in the Signalr library itself ?\r\n\r\nIn the context of my application we only send message to groups, so technically i could only remove the user from the all the groups that he is part of, but even that can\u0027t work because the group manager doesn\u0027t all to remove user from group, only connection.",

Aborting the socket needs to happen from the server where that socket is. It\u0027s simple an reliable (at least is should be) and there\u0027s no possibility of missing the notification because redis went down or because a backplane is poorly written.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to store the HubContext from the Hub in a custom manager then if you determine that that connection should be closed you can call Abort on the HubContext. And you can add support for users in your manager so you can close all connections for a user. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/5333#issuecomment-565528090\r\n\r\nThe problem with supplying an `Abort(string connectionId)` type API on `IHubContext` is that we likely wont make it work across the backplane which would be unexpected behavior to a user of the API. So we\u0027re hesitant to add that API.\r\n\r\nWe might just want to document the recommended approach for users to implement if they want this type of feature\r\ncc @bradygaster ",

        "body":  "\u003c!--\r\nThis template is useful to build consensus about whether work should be done, and if so, the high-level shape of how it should be approached. Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a WebSocket is closed prematurely, the application pipe will complete with no exception. As a server, we need to catch this kind of error in our higher layer codes and log it in our specific format or add some special logic.\r\nIf the pipe closes very normally, we can\u0027t tell whether it\u0027s a real normal close or unexpected close.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/common/Http.Connections/src/Internal/Transports/WebSocketsServerTransport.cs#L179\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\nUnexpected close should not swallow in such low layer. It can throw rethrow a new exception such as `ClosedPrematurelyException` to tell application layer an unexpected/network issue. As a service provider, if we can\u0027t tell the close reason easily, we lose many opportunities.\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\n# Detailed design\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s often best not to fill this out until you get basic consensus about the above. When you do, consider adding an implementation proposal with the following headings:\r\n\r\nDetailed design\r\nDrawbacks\r\nConsidered alternatives\r\nOpen questions\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nIf there\u0027s one clear design you have consensus on, you could do that directly in a PR.\r\n--\u003e\r\n",

This repo, or somewere else?\r\n- How does a client implementation interact with the Autobahn? E.g. like gRPC interop tests via command line?\r\n\r\n## Test Coverage\r\nRegarding the test coverage I think we want to cover as much as possible of the spec. Here is a brief overview. These are directly extracted from the [Hub Protocol Spec](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md).\r\n### Protocol\r\n#### Flows\r\nAll supported communication flows should be covered. This means **handshake**, **invocations**, **streaming**, **non-blocking-invocations**, **ping**, **reconnect** and **close** (peacefull and unexpected). **Message headers** are currently not used, but are part of the spec so they should be included.\r\n\r\n#### Encoding\r\nThe spec defines two encodings (JSON and MessagePack). All flows should be tested with both encodings.\r\n\r\n### Transport\r\nAll flows should should support the different transport layers covered in [Transport Protocols Spec](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/docs/specs/TransportProtocols.md).\r\nThis includes WebSockets, Server-Sent Events and Long Polling. The **negotiation** phase should be covered as well.",

The [grpc-interop-tests](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/interop-test-descriptions.md) describe a set of tests to be implemented for client and server implementations. From what I can see by skimming the docs they have [connection-backoff-interop-test-description.md](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/connection-backoff-interop-test-description.md), [http2-interop-test-descriptions.md](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/http2-interop-test-descriptions.md) and [interop-test-descriptions.md](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/interop-test-descriptions.md) test descriptions. Each specifiying tests for parts of the spec. They use program args to interface with the implementation. That way they pass down a test name which should be run by the client/server. Then they provide a script to run the server and client.  \r\n\u003e  For convenience, we provide a shell script wrapper that invokes both server and client at the same time, with the same test_case. This is the preferred way to run these tests.\r\n\r\n[Autobahn|Testsuite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite) on the other hand provides a docker image to test against client/server implementations. They also provide some nice tools for developing\r\n\r\n\u003e Besides the automated testsuite (aka \"fuzzing\" server/client), wstest also includes a number of other handy modes\r\n\u003e - WebSocket echo server and client\r\n\u003e - WebSocket broadcast server (and client driver)\r\n\u003e - Testee modes to test [AutobahnPython](http://autobahn.ws/python) against the test suite\r\n\u003e - wsperf controller and master (see below for more)\r\n\u003e - WAMP server and client, for developing WAMP implementations\r\n\u003e - WebSocket Mass-Connect\r\n\r\nInstead of using cmd line args, like grpc, a client has to open a new connection to the autobahn-test-server (fuzzingserver) specifiying what test to run via query string params.",

I think developing a client it could be quite nice to have similar features. When a tests fails a user can inspect where it went wrong by e.g. inspecting the network traffic.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the idea of developing a POC SignalR-Autobahn first. The main goal is to establish a framework that allows the development of autobahn-signalr tests. It shouldn\u0027t be too much about the tests themselves, but rather about the environment. That way we can see what works and what doesn\u0027t and what features are needed. This also allows developers to implement their own autobahn-tests without understanding the whole autobahn pipeline.

Might be too much work. But you hit a crucial point here: If we go for \"every implementation manually implements the test cases\" we need to make sure to provide examples and proper documentation on each test case so there is no confusion on what implementations have to do.\r\n",

I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because it saves on syntax?\n\nIn my case at least, the response size is because of repetitive data that compresses pretty well (coordinates and the like).\n\nI look forward to hearing more.",

It means that a secret cannot be sent together with user-generated data in a single compression context, otherwise that secret could be extracted. To bring a user’s attention to these implications and help them weigh the risks, we named one of the key APIs DangerousDeflateOptions. We also added the ability to turn off compression for specific messages, so if the user would want to send a secret, they could do that securely without compression.\r\n\r\nThe reason it\u0027s marked `Cost:L` is because we would want to enable the ability to turn off compression per message to avoid CRIME and BREACH attacks on sensitive data. Just having a global on switch without the option to turn it off is not good. Additionally, it looks like browsers don\u0027t even support per message opt-out of compression which makes it even more dangerous to enable this feature without some consideration for preventing browsers from using compression.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts; should pings be compressed? They are only 11 bytes in json, 3 bytes in msgpack. How much would the message actually be compressed? Is the cpu cost worth the small size savings? Should we also compress other small messages or find some threshold where we think it becomes useful to compress the message?",

Just having a global on switch without the option to turn it off is not good. \r\n\r\nI get your point, and those are certainly valid considerations. \r\n\r\nHowever, I feel that not exposing the compression feature unnecessarily closes out many valid and secure use cases for SignalR. In our case, we\u0027re using it to stream a lot of structural, well-compressing data over websockets. There\u0027s nothing sensitive in the messages so CRIME, BREACH etc. do not really apply. And the compression overhead for pings etc. would be negligible.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re currently working around this by compressing the data manually before sending, and decompressing it in the browser using a JavaScript library. This technically works, but it\u0027s a bit of an awkward and suboptimal solution when there\u0027s already native support for compression both in the browser and the server.\r\n\r\nWouldn\u0027t it be sufficient to just have the field name clearly indicate that enabling the compression might cause security issues in some scenarios (DangerousEnableCompression)? That way the SignalR applications could make the decision based on their own usage patterns and take advantage of the existing features for compression. This would be an awesome first step while the more granular options are designed and implemented some time later.\r\n\r\nFWIW SignalR already can do message compression with long-polling if the ResponseCompression middleware is enabled. I could see the websocket compression as a similar feature to this: compression can be used if the user explicitly enables the compression and bypasses all the \"dangerous\" warnings.",

The only reason I can find in the original design for needing to specify WebSockets is a comment about users might file an issue if they see a negotiate with the setting set https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR/pull/2070#discussion_r182502822. Which isn\u0027t a huge issue, especially if we put doc comments on the setting and have a log if we fallback with the setting set.\r\n\r\nFortunately, if we did this change it wouldn\u0027t break any existing apps because they are all required to specify the WebSocket transport already. And the behavior of not trying other transports if you specify a specific one won\u0027t change if we modify the behavior as proposed.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ll need to think about this a little to see if there are any other downsides.",

This should send a message to all users, including the one that sent the message, because the user could have the chat open on several devices, and this allows their other devices to get the chat message.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I\u0027d like to avoid sending the chat message to the specific original client/device that sent the message. Since most chat messages are between two users in the system, this would cut my message send by almost half if I could do this. This could be achieved with a method `IHubClients.UsersExceptClients()`, which would let me specify what users to send to (where each user can have several clients) but to exclude a specific client (and I\u0027d send in the connection id from the client side to the server for this purpose).\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add this feature?",

We rely on many TCP features like ordering and flow control which we would need to reimplement if we were using UDP.",

Starting to realize I could really use some help from @nibanks, on the quic team, to explain why there might be a compelling argument for supporting WebTransport.  Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, doesn\u0027t every tcp/websocket connection lock up resources (ie like memory for send/recv buffers) on the kernel side?  I\u0027ve also seen benchmarks where latency increases as the number of tcp connections, which the kernel must multiplex, moves into the thousands.  With webtransport, as opposed to to websocket, I believe it\u0027s a single udp socket and the rest (ie per connection data structures) gets handled in user space.  Incredibly efficient.",

Then it needs to parse the QPACK-compressed CONNECT request in the request stream and responds with status 200.\r\nThe problem is, both QUIC API and QPACK helper classes are `internal`. I am dealing with the QUIC connection directly since there is no way to customize the one in Kestral. Moreover, I have to tweak the `msquic` wrapper to support older versions of Windows.\r\n\r\nSo, I wish .NET expose QUIC API and HTTP/3 helper classes as public APIs or separate nuget packages such that we don\u0027t have to wait until November and a big Visual Studio update for .NET 7.",

The message sends successfully if AddStackExchangeRedis is removed. This happens in production and with a simple containerised Redis instance locally.\r\n\r\nWhile messages this large are not typical, it would be nice to know what determines this limit and if/where it can be configured.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe user is made aware of the size/timeout limitation and can account for it/reconfigure.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Configure a typical SignalR setup with a hub and client code\r\n2. Enable a Redis backplane with `AddStackExchangeRedis`\r\n3. Send a message to a connected client with a large payload (e.g 36MB)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.StackExchangeRedis.RedisHubLifetimeManager: Error: Connection to Redis failed.`\r\n`StackExchange.Redis.RedisConnectionException: SocketClosed (ReadEndOfStream, last-recv: 0) on localhost:6379/Subscription, Idle/MarkProcessed, last: SUBSCRIBE, origin: ReadFromPipe, outstanding: 0, last-read: 0s ago, last-write: 44s ago, keep-alive: 60s, state: ConnectedEstablished, mgr: 9 of 10 available, in: 0, in-pipe: 0, out-pipe: 0, last-heartbeat: 0s ago, last-mbeat: 0s ago, global: 0s ago, v: 2.0.593.37019`\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.101\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

This isn\u0027t a typical scenario for a payload this size but it happened and it raises the question of where/what the limit is. I just don\u0027t want to find out \u0027the hard way\u0027 that it\u0027s say, 5MB. We just want to be able to account for it as currently it fails silently. My assumption was that Redis doesn\u0027t actually handle the payload and was just maintaining connections when scaled out.",

We will re-evaluate this issue, during our next planning meeting(s). \nIf we later determine, that the issue has no community involvement, or it\u0027s very rare and low-impact issue, we will close it - so that the team can focus on more important and high impact issues.\nTo learn more about what to expect next and how this issue will be handled you can read more about our triage process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/TriageProcess.md).",

We will re-evaluate this issue, during our next planning meeting(s). \nIf we later determine, that the issue has no community involvement, or it\u0027s very rare and low-impact issue, we will close it - so that the team can focus on more important and high impact issues.\nTo learn more about what to expect next and how this issue will be handled you can read more about our triage process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/TriageProcess.md).",

Normally a `Logger` applies to a class and works within the class context for tagging reasons.  It does not make sense to keep passing a single instance of `HubConnection` logger from `ConfigureLogging` to other classes as you\u0027ll end up losing the logs context due to a single tag. \r\n\r\nWe are, however, planning to change SignalR to start using a simple string for log tagging rather than the full package name plus class name.  \r\n\r\nWe will change all the loggers to use the following format: ` Logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"SignalR.\u003cClassName\u003e\")`.  Example for HubConnection class: ` Logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"SignalR.HubConnection\")` We hope that proguard/obfuscator will not mess up with that string and you should be able to process logs with `SignalR.\u003cClassName\u003e` prefix. Let us know if this will work for you. ",

I really like working with SignalR (as I have done in other projects), but due to these complexities I think it\u0027s best to refrain from using SignalR with Unity + Android. :)",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI am trying to add W3C Trace Context to our client\u0027s SignalR calls over WebSockets.\r\n\r\nOur client generates a root trace ID when the page loads, and we are able to use interceptors on our REST calls to add the trace context to HTTP requests very easily, and ASP.NET Core automatically handles mapping the trace context to `System.Diagnostics.Activity.Current`. This allows us to do distributed tracing and track requests initiated by a single user\u0027s page load across all of our services.\r\n\r\nI would like the same thing for SignalR: automatic sending (for clients) and parsing (for servers/hubs) of W3C trace context, as well as handling `Activity.Current`. This may only be applicable to the browser-based WebSocket clients, since you should be able to set arbitrary HTTP headers, including `traceparent` and `tracestate`, using other clients/transports, and I assume those would still be parsed by ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\nI found a workaround to do this in the browser, but it passes the trace context using a query string parameter in the connection URL, which I am not sure is supported or not. It also requires you to manually reset the current for each hub method call, which is easy to miss.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI would like it if there was a way to specify a trace context in the client libraries and send it to the hub somehow, and for the `HubContext` to automatically parse the context and set `Activity.Current` accordingly. (This would require some trickery for JS/browser clients since browsers don\u0027t allow extra headers in WebSocket connections.)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```javascript\r\n/**\r\n  * Add W3C trace context to the negotiation and connection requests\r\n  * @param {string?} traceparent - Parent trace context string.\r\n  *   If not specified, a random context will be created.\r\n  */\r\nfunction withTraceContext(traceparent: string?) {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n  .withUrl(\"/myHub\")\r\n  .withTraceContext()\r\n  .build()\r\n```\r\nIn my example, the hub methods\u0027 parent activity is a \"StartSession\" activity created on connection, but I would probably be fine if the parent was set to the client\u0027s trace context directly.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to have another property in `HubContext` or a magic key in `HubContext.Items` :magic_wand: (e.g. `Context.Items[\"traceparent\"]`) that is automatically parsed by the hub. That way, the user could decide how they want to get the trace context to the hub on the initial connection and parse it in `OnConnectedAsync`. From there, the `HubContext` could automatically pick up the trace context from that `HubContext` property or `Item`.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have found a way to add this, but it feels a little hacky:\r\n\r\nIn the client:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// client.js\r\nconst traceparent = TraceContext.getRootContext().toString() // 00-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-01\r\nconst connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n  .withUrl(`${baseUrl}/myhub?traceparent=${traceparent}`)\r\n  .build();\r\nconnection.on(/* ... */)\r\nconnection.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the server:\r\n```csharp\r\n//MyHub.cs\r\npublic class MyHub\r\n{\r\n// ...\r\n    public Task OnConnectedAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        ActivityContext activityCtx = default;\r\n        var httpCtx = Context.GetHttpContext();\r\n        if (httpCtx.Request.Query.TryGetValue(\"traceparent\", out StringValues tpParam) \u0026\u0026 tpParam.SingleOrDefault() is string traceParent)\r\n        {\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                string traceState = (httpCtx.Request.Query.TryGetValue(\"tracestate\", out StringValues tsParam)) ? tsParam.SingleOrDefault() : null;\r\n                if (ActivityContext.TryParse(traceParent, traceState, out activityCtx)) { }\r\n            }\r\n            catch { }\r\n        }\r\n        Activity activity = MyDiagnostics.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\"MyHub.StartSession\", ActivityKind.Client, activityCtx);\r\n        Context.Items[\"tracecontext\"] = activity;\r\n        return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public async Task DoSomething()\r\n    {\r\n        // Add this line to the beginning of every hub method.\r\n        using var activity = StartActivity($\"{nameof(MyHub)}.{nameof(DoSomething)});\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private Activity GetCurrentConnectionActivity()\r\n    {\r\n        return Context.Items[\"tracecontext\"] as Activity;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private Activity StartActivity(string operation)\r\n    {\r\n        return MyDiagnostics.ActivitySource.StartActivity(operation, ActivityKind.Client, GetCurrentConnectionActivity().Context);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// MyDiagnostics.cs\r\n\r\npublic static class MyDiagnostics\r\n{\r\n    public static readonly ActivitySource ActivitySource = StartActivitySource();\r\n\r\n    private static ActivitySource StartActivitySource()\r\n    {\r\n        var source = new ActivitySource(\r\n            \"MyActivitySource\",\r\n            FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfo(Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(MyDiagnostics))!.Location).FileVersion\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        ActivitySource.AddActivityListener(new ActivityListener\r\n        {\r\n            ShouldListenTo = s =\u003e true,\r\n            SampleUsingParentId = (ref ActivityCreationOptions\u003cstring\u003e activityOptions) =\u003e ActivitySamplingResult.AllData,\r\n            Sample = (ref ActivityCreationOptions\u003cActivityContext\u003e activityOptions) =\u003e ActivitySamplingResult.AllData,\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        return source;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",

I was taking a deeper look to understand a bug that we\u0027ve encountered and I just ran across the callback id. However, in general, we have done a lot of performance testing of our application and the impact of using the c++ signalr library in the past. \r\n\r\nMost of our installations are on small boards (rpi 3b+ or smaller, all the way down to a tiny 454Mz/64Mb). On those boards, we\u0027re limited in both CPU and mem. It\u0027s worth noting that the RPi 3B+ is the smallest board we\u0027ve attempted to use signalr on. \r\n\r\nOur implementations tend to process data up to speeds of 300Hz. Our mem footprint and cpu impact is typically rather small (in the single digits). However, when we start using signalr on a rpi 3b+, cpu usage ramps up and becomes the big consumer by several factors. We\u0027ve taken a lot of steps to reduce the number of allocations before we hand anything over to the signalr api. We also only send messages when something has changed (i.e. if we\u0027re monitoring 125 states and only 2 change, then we send those changes -- for each timeslice). The goal is to provide data to a site so that other can watch what is happening in the lab/robots/etc.\r\n\r\nIn general, though, it just feels like signalr is not as well-tuned as we had hoped. On a recent application, we had to downgrade our processing from 100Hz to 10Hz so that signalr would work on the board. Otherwise, the cpu was clearly overloaded and everything would be impacted.\r\n\r\nThus, when I see something like a string-based key, it makes me wonder -- why? I get that the server is going to send it to as a string or vice-versa, but until it\u0027s actually needed as a string, wouldn\u0027t the best course of action be to leave it as an int (for lookups, etc)? Temp string is created, then copied, then another is created based on that string, etc. Also, string lookups/finds/comparisons are also pretty expensive. Between get_callback_id() and where the key is stored, there are at least 6 allocations (3 in get_callback_id and 3 more with the insert). If that key had been an int, there would be only a single allocation for the pair insertion. \r\n\r\nAre there other places where the api can be smarter about what is handling and how?  Those are the types of questions we ask of our own code.\r\n\r\nWe really like signalr from the web server side of things and not once has signalr\u0027s perf impact on the web server has come into question (it\u0027s noise on a web server with beefy everything) but getting data to the web server from a small system is key. If the api is not careful with what it\u0027s doing, then it will over-consume and make it harder to justify its use.\r\n",

And we\u0027re still mostly focused on getting the functionality up to par with the other client and ironing out bugs.\r\n\r\nWe can easily remove 1 of the temporary string allocations, and we\u0027ll do that at a minimum. I\u0027m still trying to convince myself that storing an int is ok from a protocol correctness standpoint. It might be since it\u0027s only used for sending from the client.

Create a simple Hub server\r\n2. Shorten `ClientTimeoutInterval` to 5 seconds: `services.AddSignalR(o=\u003eo.ClientTimeoutInterval=TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));`\r\n3. Override OnDisconnectedAsync in the hub and insert a breakpoint there\r\n4. F5 to start debugging my hub\r\n5. OnDisconnectedAsync is never triggered because KeepAlive check is disabled when Debugger is attached: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/88ee825bca9978df7f1d8c8c09b71b6dffeeb53b/src/SignalR/server/Core/src/HubConnectionContext.cs#L656 \n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.203\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

And was using SignalR in an NUnit test method. \r\nBut I think there is **not really an issue.** So I a posting my solution for anyone else who lands here.\r\n\r\n- When I ran my app without debugging (in a normal run), SignalR worked; my clients got the message.\r\n- But in debug mode it seemed like the messages I was sending were not making it to my SignalR hub.\r\n- I found out that the real problem was that the StartAsync() method on the hub initialization needed to have an \"await\" in front of it.\r\n- This means I really needed to put the hub initialization and \" await _hubConnection.StartAysnc()\" code inside an async method.\r\n- If you think about it, a method that says \"startAysnc\" *must* need to be inside an async method.\r\n- However, the IDE only gives you a little green line about this, not a full blown error.\r\n- I wanted the hub connection and StartAysnc() method to be in NUnit\u0027s \"Setup()\" method. By default the VS NUnit template does not make this method aysnc, so I just didn\u0027t see it.\r\n\r\nSo that was the solution for me: change my \"Setup()\" method to aysnc and then do awaits like this:\r\n\r\n  await _hubConnection.StartAsync();\r\n  await _hubConnection.InvokeAsync(\"ExecuteMyMethodOnTheHub\");\r\n\r\nNote that the hub initialization code does NOT require awaits . . . . so it\u0027s easy to miss this.\r\n\r\nWhy this worked in Run mode, but not in debug mode, I don\u0027t understand. But that consistently happened for me. Was driving me crazy.\r\n\r\nIt seems like  maybe the .Net framework should trigger a red-squiggly  if you fail to put await in front of _hubConnection.StartAsync();.\r\n\r\nSignalR is a great technology, Microsoft did a great job with it and I hope to see it continued to be pushed forward. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHi,\r\nI try to create a lib to communicate with SignalR from an Arduino ([ESP32S2 Saola](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-saola-1-v1.2.html) to be precise) and I\u0027m using [HubProtocol.md](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md) as reference for my dev.\r\n\r\nAs Arduino is a very limited device, I want to use MessagePack as serialization and websocket as transport but I\u0027ve 2 \"issues\". \r\n\r\n1) The HandshakeResponse is sended in binary and not in text\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s not really an issue, I can manage a response in binary but in [TransportProtocols.md](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/docs/specs/TransportProtocols.md) it is specified this \"When using a text-based protocol like JSON, it is preferable for the WebSockets transport to use Text frames.\". As Handshake is always in json, I\u0027ve waited for a response in text. Maybe, it\u0027s a good idea to specify in the document that when using MessagePack, the reponse will be in binary.\r\n\r\n2) In regular frame after Handshake, I have 1 unspecified byte more in frame\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve verified with Wireshark the problem :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13921115/185906644-9fa67b50-7ff6-475c-91b3-346c6ab80ba0.png)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the payload, 0x82 0x03 is a correct websocket header that specify a binary frame with 3 bytes of payload and 0x91 0x06 is a valid Ping message but what is 0x02 ? I have checked the whole documentation and nowhere it\u0027s specified a header or something else between the websocket header and the message. For reference, I quote the Ping message specification :\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13921115/185907896-c39dda09-afa8-4846-aa0b-0e63fc0e88fa.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSuppression of the \"unwanted\" byte or a modification of the specification to tell what is this byte to be able to write a conform client\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nMy test program (on C# side) is very simple, 1 aspnet core project with 1 SignalR hub:\r\n\r\nProgram.cs:\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace Arduino.SignalR.Client.DemoServer\r\n{\r\n    public class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\n            builder.Services.AddSignalR().AddMessagePackProtocol();\r\n\r\n            var app = builder.Build();\r\n\r\n            app.MapHub\u003cTestHub\u003e(\"/TestHub\");\r\n\r\n            app.Run();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTestHub.cs:\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;\r\n\r\nnamespace Arduino.SignalR.Client.DemoServer\r\n{\r\n    public class TestHub : Hub\r\n    {\r\n        public async Task EchoMessage(string message)\r\n        {\r\n            await Clients.All.SendAsync(\"ReceivedMessage\", message);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Arduino side is a little more complexe and could be find here [Arduino.SignalR.Client](https://github.com/EscapeAutomate/Arduino.SignalR.Client). It\u0027s a WIP :)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.400\n\n### Anything else?\n\nASP.NET Core version: 6.0\r\nIDE: Visual studio for C# and Cpp\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet --info\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   6.0.400\r\n Commit:    7771abd614\r\n\r\nEnvironnement d\u0027exécution :\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19044\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.400\\\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  Not found\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      6.0.8\r\n  Architecture: x64\r\n  Commit:       55fb7ef977\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  2.2.207 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.422 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.303 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.408 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.203 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.303 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.28 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.28 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.28 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nDownload .NET:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n\r\nLearn about .NET Runtimes and SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/runtimes-sdk-info\r\n```",

Please describe the problem.\n\nI made a silly mistake today that took me some time to debug because there appears to be no easy way to access the underlying messages sent by SignalR as plaintext.\r\n\r\nI have a method where I added a cancellationTokenSource as such.\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing (var cancelToken = new CancellationTokenSource(timeoutMS))\r\n{\r\n     return clientProxy.InvokeAsync\u003cT\u003e(methodName, request, cancelToken);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou might already be able to spot the problem (cancelToken should be cancelToken.Token) I had forgotten about this simple change I made and suddenly started getting the error:\r\n\r\n**Error reading JSON.\r\n\u0027{\u0027 is invalid after a value. Expected either \u0027,\u0027, \u0027}\u0027, or \u0027]\u0027. LineNumber: 0 | BytePositionInLine: 98.**\r\n\r\nI tried to enable detailed logging by adding trace for logging messages.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar conn = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n.ConfigureLogging(logging =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Trace);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet unfortunately I received no further details other than the message above.\r\n\r\nIn the end I needed to implement my own custom IHubProtocol by duplicating JsonHubProtocol which finally revealed the real error to me which was: \r\n\r\n`{\"type\":1,\"invocationId\":\"9\",\"target\":\"blahblah\",\"arguments\":[{blahblah}{\"type\":7,\"error\":\"Connection closed with an error. NotSupportedException: Serialization and deserialization of \u0027System.IntPtr\u0027 instances are not supported. Path: $.Token.WaitHandle.Handle.\",\"allowReconnect\":true}`\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI believe inside JsonHubProtocol -\u003e ParseMessage on the error condition the entire message payload should be shown to the user or at least if tracing is turned on this should be the behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt should not be this difficult to find out what happened to cause deserialisation to fail.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIn summary, there should be more information when an error condition occurs deep inside the protocol.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nRight now, I can send messages to an individual user using their NameIdentifier and `Clients.User(nameIdentifier).SendAsync`.  I can also send messages to a group of connections using a group name and `Clients.Group(groupName).SendAsync`.  However, unless I\u0027m missing something, I can\u0027t send a message to a group of users (user as identified by nameIdentifier, not connection ID) at the SignalR level.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI\u0027d like to be able to send messages to a group of users (user as identified by nameIdentifier, not connection ID) at the SignalR level.\n\n### Additional context\n\nYes, this can of course be done with a roll-your-own backplane, track your own users as a group, and send to multiple users in SignalR according to the group you\u0027ve defined for yourself.  But the beauty of Groups and Users in SignalR is that they inherently support scaling up to multiple SignalR server instances and your code doesn\u0027t have to worry about ensuring that the message gets sent out to all SignalR instances.\r\n\r\nIf I roll-my-own backplane, I have 2 options:\r\n1) Implement my own mechanism for grouping users by nameIdentifier, then when I want to send a message to all users in that group, use `Clients.Users(nameIdentifiers)`.  This will work, but each time a server wants to send to the group, it\u0027ll have to go to a backplane or database to retrieve the list of all users in that group; it can\u0027t use SignalR\u0027s existing scaling architecture to just \"send to all users in this UserGroup\", which would be more convenient and efficient.\r\n2) Use `Clients.Group(groupName)`.  Each time a user joins a group, I add their connection ID into that named group, then send to that group to send to all group users.  But what about when the user reconnects with a new ID?  I need to worry about adding their new ID back into the appropriate groups.  And what about when they leave the group?  I know their current ID, but not any others associated with their nameIdentifier that may have been added.  Seems like this won\u0027t really work.\r\n\r\nIf, however, SignalR offered the concept of UserGroup, I\u0027d add a user to a group when necessary, remove them when necessary, and when I needed to send a message to all group users by nameIdentifier, I\u0027d send it to that UserGroup.  A user disconnecting/reconnecting is fine because their nameIdentifier is still in that UserGroup so nothing needs to happen.  A user leaving is fine, because my server instance can just remove that nameIdentifier from the UserGroup.  And when I need to send a message to all users in the UserGroup, I don\u0027t need to spend extra resources going off to a backplane or DB; it\u0027s utilizing the one that already exists because I\u0027ve scaled up SignalR and setup a SignalR backplane already.",

The nlohmann library is a header-only library (https://github.com/nlohmann/json).\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\nThere are a few reasons why a header-only json library might fit better with signalR.\r\n\r\n1) Less to build - every library that signalr depends upon needs to be built. this might eventually make it harder to build/deploy signalr for non-standard platforms (e.g. we went through a 9-month period where vcpkg could not be used on RPi due to a variety of issues. adding jsoncpp as a dependency simply makes that potential problem surface area even larger).\r\n\r\n2) Less to deploy - each library dependency increases the final set of deployment files.\r\n\r\n3) Better performance - parse time and peak memory stats for nlohmann are better than jsoncpp.  The less time it takes to process json, the better. The less impact on memory, even better.  Small boards with limited resources don\u0027t need to spend extra time parsing and memory allocs are super slow. Here\u0027s a handy reference that illustrates various benchmarks for common json libraries, including both jsoncpp and nlohmann, https://lokiastari.com/Json/Performance.linux.html\r\n\r\n## In scope\r\nChanging library dependency.\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\nPerformance testing of libraries. It\u0027s been done by others.\r\n\r\n## Risks / unknowns\r\nIncorporating this change should effectively backing out the compilation and deployment changes introduced with alpha4.\r\n",

In the scenario where the power is off, for whatever reason, the stations can boot into the application(Client) quickly. The Server takes maybe a couple of minutes to get all the services ready. So the Server Hub  is not immediately available. In the current code. The clients would require a User input to restart or code added to  loop and wait for the connection. If the Client HubConnection has a RetryPolicy, we should not have to write extra code to handle this scenario.\r\n**So a boolean property can be added to the IRetryPolicy:**\r\n` /// \u003csummary\u003e\r\n    /// When true this property tells the HubConnetion to run this RetryPolicy when an initial connection cannot be established. This allows for\r\n    /// clients to attempt to connect to a server that may be late in starting up, or failed on startup and requires a restart. The clients can then\r\n    /// reconnect when the server becomes available, if NextRetryDelay has not receives a null.\r\n    /// \u003c/summary\u003e`\r\n    **bool? RetryOnStart { get; set; } =\u003e false;**\r\n\r\n**Then by making three changes to the HubConnection code:**\r\nChange this:\r\n**`private async Task StartAsyncCore(CancellationToken cancellationToken)`**\r\nTo this:\r\n`private async Task StartAsyncCore(CancellationToken cancellationToken,`**_bool fromReconnectAsync = false_**`)`\r\n\r\n**Add this to the StartAsyncCore method when HandshakeAsync fails**:\r\n` //[DS]If Handshake fails, and this is the first attempt, start ReconnectAsync only once.\r\n  //[CAUTION] The ReconnectAsync method calls this method so there is a chase scenario.`\r\n            **_if (_reconnectPolicy.RetryOnStart \u0026\u0026 !fromReconnectAsync)\r\n                await ReconnectAsync(ex);_**\r\n**Then lastly, change the call arguments to StartAsyncCore in the ReconnectAsync method from:**\r\n**_await StartAsyncCore(_state.StopCts.Token).ConfigureAwait(false);_**\r\nto:\r\n**_await StartAsyncCore(_state.StopCts.Token, true).ConfigureAwait(false);_**",

Let me explain my scenario:\r\n\r\nI have a SignalR application that is multi-tenant, when the request comes in\r\n\r\n1. I\u0027m resolving the Tenant from the subdomain in the Request, which works fine in API and SignalR middleware\r\n2. After retrieving the the Tenant it validates the user token using the tenant authentication options, basically custom JwtBearer options with a custom scheme per tenant\r\n3. The authentication goes well and then it leaves the Request and enters the Hub Invocation\r\n4. In the Hub I have a few services that depend on Tenant information to be created (some tenant may have different implementations of a service)\r\n5. That is where it breaks, I cannot access this scope from Hub invocation before the hub is created, or before the service arguments of a method are resolved. I need that to resolve the Tenant again inside the Hub invocation scope, there are no extension points.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I have all the information to resolve the Tenant, but I cannot resolve before instantiating the dependencies because there are no extension points.\r\n\r\nI added a HubFilter, but at the time the HubFilter executes all the Hub dependencies were resolved.",

Then you will get **the same** (since/if the service is scoped) but configured service instance in a Hub constructor via dependency injection.\r\nI have used this approach to centralize and abstract away the workaround and to have a clean dependency injection into `Hub` constructor instead of having to resolve service from the service provider as suggested by @davidfowl  [just above](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/46095#issuecomment-1607743272).",

We\u0027ve discussed it but the implementation is tricky so motivating examples would help.\r\n\r\nIn our case we have a .NET-based client and server for monitoring devices at remote sites and are using SignalR to add a feature to the client that allows occasional remote access via the user\u0027s browser to the device administration web pages for configuration by proxying HTTP traffic from the server to the client. (Access is limited to specific devices the user has permission to access remotely.)\r\n\r\nThere are other approaches to this one could take such as creating an SSH reverse proxy, but after exploring and prototyping a number of options SignalR will be the easiest to integrate into our existing client/server apps and the performance seems acceptable for our use case.\r\n\r\nStreaming client results are not required for 95% of our use cases, as most HTTP responses can be handled by choosing an appropriate max message size, but some devices support things like downloading dumps of troubleshooting information which can be into the tens or hundreds of MB, and it would be nice to support this use case.\r\n\r\n\u003e The benefit of client results if really keeping the state machine in a single async flow vs breaking the flow and state up into multiple calls over client and server that need to be correlated.\r\n\r\nAs you mention above, one workaround is to send the response from the client as a separate one-way streaming call and correlating it with the request on the server. We used this approach in our prototype before client results were supported, and it definitely works. The main downside is the additional complexity in waiting for the response and doing the correlation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You also have a search function.  Your services might look like this with the new support. \n\n```C#\npublic class BrowserHub(IHubContext\u003cAgentHub, IAgentHubClient\u003e agentHub) : Hub\u003cIBrowserHubClient\u003e\n{\n  private readonly IHubContext\u003cAgentHub, IAgentHubClient\u003e _agentHub = agentHub;\n\n  public async IAsyncEnumerable\u003cFileSystemEntryDto\u003e GetFileSystemEntries(Guid deviceId, string parentPath)\n  {\n     var agentConnectionId = await GetAgentConnectionId(deviceId);\n     var fileSystemEntries = _agentHub.Clients\n        .Client(agentConnectionId)\n        .GetFileSystemEntries(parentPath);\n\n     await foreach (var fileSystemEntry in fileSystemEntries)\n     {\n       yield return fileSystemEntry;\n     }\n  }\n\n  public async IAsyncEnumerable\u003cFileSystemEntryDto\u003e SearchFileSystemEntries(Guid deviceId, string parentPath, string searchPattern)\n  {\n     var agentConnectionId = await GetAgentConnectionId(deviceId);\n     var fileSystemEntries = _agentHub.Clients\n       .Client(agentConnectionId)\n       .SearchFileSystemEntries(parentPath, searchPattern);\n\n     await foreach (var fileSystemEntry in fileSystemEntries)\n     {\n       yield return fileSystemEntry;\n     }\n  }\n}\n\n// In shared abstractions library.\npublic interface IAgentHubClient\n{\n  IAsyncEnumerable\u003cFileSystemEntryDto\u003e GetFileSystemEntries(string parentPath);\n  IAsyncEnumerable\u003cFileSystemEntryDto\u003e SearchFileSystemEntries(string parentPath, string searchPattern);\n}\n\n```\n\nHowever, as far as I\u0027m aware (please correct me if I\u0027m wrong), this isn\u0027t currently possible with SignalR.  The changes proposed in this issue would be required to support this flow (i.e. returning `IAsyncEnumerable\u003cT\u003e` from the agent\u0027s client interface).\n\nFor listing items at a specific path, I don\u0027t want to return a realized collection, since it might be larger than max message size.  Same for search, plus I\u0027d also like them to show in the browser immediately as they\u0027re found.\n\nWe do currently have some search functions and output streaming in our agent that is invoked from the server.  However, since our agent has both a SignalR connection and a separate websocket connection, we implemented these using StreamJsonRpc over the raw websocket connection, which supports returning `IAsyncEnumerable\u003cT\u003e` from the client.  (One of these connections will be refactored out, though, as the redundancy was a result of other consolidations.)\n\nAnyhow, if I wanted to implement similar functionality over the SignalR connection with the currently-available APIs, I think I\u0027d have to use an intermediate service to \"hand off\" the stream.  I implemented this before in a personal project, but it only worked in-memory and didn\u0027t support a distributed backend environment.  I also didn\u0027t like it.  The code isn\u0027t used anymore, but some of it is still in the repo.  It\u0027s also sending opaque byte chunks in this example.  Here\u0027s the gist.\n\n- \"Viewer\" (e.g. browser) requests a stream from the agent.  (code was removed)\n- Viewer calls [another hub method](https://github.com/bitbound/ControlR/blob/main/ControlR.Web.Server/Hubs/ViewerHub.cs#L536) to get the stream.\n- Viewer [waits for ready signal](https://github.com/bitbound/ControlR/blob/main/ControlR.Web.Server/Services/StreamStore.cs#L47) from agent.\n- Agent sends up an `IAsyncEnumerable\u003cT\u003e` to `AgentHub`, whichs adds stream to `IStreamStore`. (code was removed)\n- Signaling and \"hand off\" is done through [an item](https://github.com/bitbound/ControlR/blob/main/ControlR.Web.Server/Helpers/StreamSignaler.cs) in the store.\n- Method in `AgentHub` awaits end signal.  (code was removed)\n\nAgain, I didn\u0027t like this, since it seemed very hacky.  The proposed changes would make it a lot cleaner and succinct.",

I\u0027d consider the example of searching the file system (or other data store on a remote device) as streaming.  You don\u0027t know how long the search will take to complete, and you want results to stream back as they are found.\n\nWMI queries could also benefit from this, since the `ManagementObjectSearcher` will return items as they are found, before the whole search completes.\n\nA more outlandish example is remote control/desktop.  I implemented the below remote control app through SignalR, using the \"hand off\" pattern I described above.  This is actually from where that code originated.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/327b8ada-d0f3-47d8-9b82-72e4b9117d1c\n",

We manually chunk and reassemble the parts on the client side.\n\nWhen a client sends a large message, we now use streaming to transmit the parts, which is neat because before we needed a `ConcurrentDictionary` on the server to keep track of the individual parts of a message of a particular user, and now SignalR is doing the heavy lifting for us ✅\n\nThe other way around doesn\u0027t work though, i.e. can\u0027t invoke a client method that accepts an `IAsyncEnumerable\u003cstring\u003e`. It would be nice if we could rely on SignalR\u0027s infrastructure in both cases. \n(this scenario is simpler to implement, in our case at least, so it\u0027s not a big deal – but for consistncy it would be nice if we could use the same feature, streaming, in both cases)",

As I understand Hub Filters  are executed before the serialization.\r\nOr maybe there\u0027s some kind of SignalR Diagnostic source that I can subscribe.\r\nAnother option would be sending preserialized data, so that we can count the bytes before sending it, but as I understand that\u0027s not supported.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n",

It works fine for a small number of requests, but as soon as we start 2 Clients which send lots of requests at once, one client successfully completes all its requests and the second client halts and waits forever for its remaining requests.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the issue was introduced with net7. If the targetframework for the server application is changed to net6 both clients complete all their requests and everything works as expected.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI\u0027ve created a small test solution to reproduce the issue (see https://github.com/tobsil/SignalRTest ). This solution contains a simple server and client application. To reproduce the bug start the server and run two or mor instances of the client application at once.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n7.0.103\n\n### Anything else?\n\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:   7.0.103\r\n Commit:    276c71d299\r\n\r\nLaufzeitumgebung:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.22621\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.103\\\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      7.0.3\r\n  Architecture: x64\r\n  Commit:       0a2bda10e8\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  7.0.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nOther architectures found:\r\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\r\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables:\r\n  Not set\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  Not found\r\n\r\nLearn more:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\r\n\r\nDownload .NET:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\r\n",

That causes the dtor to run, which tries to shutdown the connection, which is blocked on your callback, ending in a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe library code can probably release the lock in this case before calling the callback.",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf an HTTP response for the opening SignalR negotiate call contains an unexpected response code, the SignalR Java client library will convert the error to an `HttpRequestException` for use by consumers of the library. However, if negotiation is skipped and a similar error occurs during the opening WebSocket handshake, the library does not return a useful exception. Instead, `OkHttpWebSocketWrapper.SignalRWebSocketListener.onFailure()` ignores the `Response` returned by OkHttp and wraps the provided `Throwable` in a `RuntimeException`.\r\n\r\nThis makes certain handleable errors, like 401, especially difficult to detect. I believe the only recourse today is to parse the error message string on the underlying `Throwable` returned by OkHttp.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen negotiation is skipped, SignalR should return `HttpRequestException`s for the opening HTTP handshake in the WebSocket protocol, so we can handle the error codes (like 401) appropriately.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Set up a basic SignalR Java client and SignalR service that supports authentication.\r\n2. Configure the SignalR client to use WebSocket transport and skip negotiation.\r\n3. Provide a bad token for the connection.\r\n\r\nExpected: SignalR Java client receives an `HttpRequestException` with a 401 code.\r\nActual: SignalR Java client receives a generic `RuntimeException`.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

I\u0027m using `esbuild` for bundeling, however, it does not correctly resolve some dependencies, like `ws`.\r\n\r\nThis is due [those hacks](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adotnet%2Faspnetcore%20__webpack_require__\u0026type=code):\r\n```ts\r\n// In order to ignore the dynamic require in webpack builds we need to do this magic\r\n// @ts-ignore: TS doesn\u0027t know about these names\r\nconst requireFunc = typeof __webpack_require__ === \"function\" ? __non_webpack_require__ : require;\r\nwebSocketModule = requireFunc(\"ws\");\r\neventSourceModule = requireFunc(\"eventsource\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t think this is an issue of `esbuild`, since it believes that this is a dynamic require. Can we somehow fix this?\r\n\r\nI confirmed that this is the issue, by patching the lib to use plain `require` instead of the `requireFunc`, then everything works correctly.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`ws` is resolved correctly when using the `bundle` option of `esbuild`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/hrueger/signalr-esbuild-issue\r\n\r\n1. `yarn install`\r\n1. `yarn build`\r\n1. See `__webpack_require__` is still in `dist/bundle.js` instead of the `ws` module embedded in the bundle.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\nn/a\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Despite providing `dist/browser/signalr.js` and `dist/webworker/signalr.js` builds there are still hacks and runtime feature detection inside the bundled code.\n\nBrowser build should never even include the `requireFunc(\"tough-cookie\")`, `requireFunc(\"node-fetch\")`, `requireFunc(\"ws\")` and other node.js specific bits.\n\nThe code hidden behind `requireFunc` hacks is a major issue for bundlers:\n- Some, like esbuild and vite, ship the dead code straight to browser, but eliminate the actual dependency from the bundle\n  - While bundling for node.js this breaks at runtime\n- Some, like webpack with module federation, might ship the `import { … } from \"module\"` to browser\n- The `esm` bundle is also broken in node.js, because `require` is not defined in ES module scope\n- Some might ship both the dead code and the unused dependencies\n- Some might fail to build completely\n\nThere\u0027s no need for webpack-specific build hacks in 2025. The proper way to do this is:\n- Remove the `requireFunc` hacks\n- Remove the runtime detection through `Platform.is` hacks\n- Instead use some form of build-time code elimination and provide separate bundles for different environments\n  - These bundles can be shipped as a single package with \"exports\" conditions or as separate packages (e.g. `@microsoft/signalr-node`, `@microsoft/signalr-browser`, `@microsoft/signalr-webworker`, `@microsoft/signalr-react-native` etc.)\n\nIf you don\u0027t want to bother with proper bundling you can also force consumers to provide the required dependencies in constructors or through polyfills:\n- `FetchHttpClient` could accept `fetch` with cookie support and jar if needed\n- `AbortController` can be an external requirement and polyfilled by the consumer if needed\n- `HttpConnection` could accept `WebSocket` and `EventSource` constructors, or rely on them existing globally\n\nBasically there\u0027s no need for this runtime extravaganza. All the dependency differences can be turned either into explicit or implicit environment requirements. ",

Once the glitch appears on http://localhost:3000, it usually persists across different tabs until the browser is closed \u0026 restarted. Something peculiar about the \"WebSocket failed to connect\" message is that it _doesn\u0027t_ appear on initial page load, it appears during reload, and when it appears it is always the very first message; notably, it appears _before_ the constructor for `new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()` is invoked.\r\n\r\nBut is it just a SignalR thing or are all websockets broken? Well, SignalR connections on different domains still work, so the problem is limited to a a particular domain, and maybe localhost only. I found that if I ran this code on Chrome:\r\n\r\n    let socket = new WebSocket(\"ws://localhost:5001/api/coordinator\");\r\n    socket.onopen = function(e) { console.warn(\"Connection established\", e); };\r\n    socket.onerror = function(e) { console.error(e); };\r\n\r\nIt immediately prints \"Connection established\". Running the same code in Firefox (in its \"glitched\" state), nothing happens (neither success nor error). So SignalR seems blameless.\r\n\r\nHowever, the SSE fallback doesn\u0027t happen after 1-2 minutes; it takes about 13 minutes and 20 seconds (800 seconds) which seems excessive! This is with @microsoft/signalr v6.0.7. When it finally does establish an SSE connection, something goes wrong and the connection fails afterward.

These errors propagate up to the application layer. Currently, it is challenging to reliably identify these errors as originating from SignalR because the `HubConnection` class creates plain `Error` types without any distinct characteristics. In our scenario, we have implemented a global error handler that notifies users visually when an unhandled error occurs.\r\n\r\nHowever, since SignalR errors can occur sporadically and independently of user actions, it is desirable to filter out these errors. Presently, we achieve this by checking if the error\u0027s message property contains a specific string, like the one mentioned earlier. Unfortunately, this approach is not reliable, as the error message can change at any time, and there are multiple variations.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to follow best practices and define a custom error type and/or set the [cause field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause#providing_structured_data_as_the_error_cause) for library specific errors. This will allow library consumer to properly catch errors thrown by the library.\r\n\r\nFrom MDN\r\n\u003e You might want to define your own error types deriving from Error to be able to throw new MyError() and use instanceof MyError to check the kind of error in the exception handler. This results in cleaner and more consistent error handling code.\r\n\u003e https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the Error.ts file already contains some error types; however, they seem to be exclusively used by the HTTP wrapper, leaving the other SignalR errors unaccounted for.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n1) Add a new error class (derived from `Error`) and set the `name` field\r\n2) Change code that uses `new Error` to use `new HubConnectionError` instead\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don\u0027t understand why the existing error types use a strange prototype workaround. I have read that it is supposed to make `instanceof` work correctly. However, in my tests, that didn\u0027t change anything, as `instanceof` checks still don\u0027t work. Therefore, it seems like it doesn\u0027t do anything? I\u0027d be interested in the background on that.\r\n\r\nDue to this reason, I have not followed this pattern in this proposal. Instead, the name field in the constructor is set. While not perfect (i.e. other error types *might* use the same name), setting the name field is a common practice and essential for making the error identifiable during a catch.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/Errors.ts\r\n+++ b/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/Errors.ts\r\n+/** Error thrown by HubConnection class. */\r\n+export class HubConnectionError extends Error {\r\n+    /** Constructs a new instance of {@link @microsoft/signalr.HubConnectionError}.\r\n+     *\r\n+     * @param {string} errorMessage A descriptive error message.\r\n+     */\r\n+    constructor(errorMessage: string) {\r\n+        super(errorMessage);\r\n+\r\n+        this.name = \"HubConnectionError\";\r\n+    }\r\n+}\r\n+\r\n--- a/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts\r\n+++ b/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts\r\n-import { AbortError } from \"./Errors\";\r\n+import { AbortError, HubConnectionError } from \"./Errors\";\r\nexport class HubConnection {\r\n             const message = \"Server returned handshake error: \" + responseMessage.error;\r\n             this._logger.log(LogLevel.Error, message);\r\n \r\n-            const error = new Error(message);\r\n+            const error = new HubConnectionError(message);\r\n             this._handshakeRejecter(error);\r\n             throw error;\r\n         } else {\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nNow we can properly catch the error by checking the `name` property that was set in the error constructor. Using `instanceof` for error checks is known to be problematic so we avoid it.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntry {\r\n    throw new HubConnectionError(\"test\");\r\n}\r\ncatch (error: any) {\r\n    if (error.name === \"HubConnectionError\") {\r\n        console.log(\u0027SignalR Error\u0027, error.name);\r\n    } else {\r\n        console.log(\u0027Other Error\u0027, error.name);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to introducing new error types, we could populate the `cause` field mentioned earlier with a value or object structure that allows us to identify these error instances as SignalR errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst DEFAULT_ERROR_CAUSE = Object.freeze({\r\n    source: \u0027signalr\u0027,\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction createError(message: string) {\r\n    throw new Error(message, { cause: DEFAULT_ERROR_CAUSE });\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\ncreateError(message);\r\n```\r\n\u003c!--\r\nWere there other options you considered, such as alternative API shapes?\r\nHow does this compare to analogous APIs in other ecosystems and libraries?\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\nPlease mention any risks that to your knowledge the API proposal might entail, such as breaking changes, performance regressions, etc.\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n- This change might be considered breaking, depending on how library consumers handle error instances.\r\n- Since the `cause` property is not available in \"es2019\" (introduced in es2022), it is likely unsuitable as it won\u0027t function on older browsers.\r\n\r\n",

        "body":  "\u003c!--\r\nThis template is useful to build consensus about whether work should be done, and if so, the high-level shape of how it should be approached. Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to add a possible `IClientFilter` to SignalR.\r\nThe goal here is to allow for engineers to filter messages being sent to clients connected to a SignalR hub, regardless of a prior hub invocation.\r\n\r\n## Motivation and goals\r\n\r\nMy main motivation to design this is to be able to collect more granular metrics regarding the messages being sent to clients like:\r\n* What transport is the client using?\r\n* What is the volume of each particular event being sent?\r\n\r\nThe implementation of given filter would allow for other scenarios like:\r\n* Tracking messages based on client/user;\r\n* Blocking a message from being sent;\r\n* Other verifications/validations done regarding a particular connection.\r\n\r\n## In scope\r\n\r\n* Middleware like filter to allow for code execution before/after a message is sent to a particular client;\r\n* Allow to block a message from being sent to a particular client;\r\n* Allow custom logic to run before/after each message is sent out;\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\n\r\n* The filter would apply only to `HubMethodInvocationMessage`s. Other message types, including messages used to control connection/flow would not run the filter;\r\n* Modification of a message being sent is also out of scope.\r\n\r\n## Risks / unknowns\r\n\r\nThe main risk here is the increased latency between a message being dispatched and it being actually sent throught a transport.\r\nAdding the possibility to run custom code before/after sending a message could increase CPU/Memory usage and slow down communication with clients.\r\nThe `IHubFilter` is instantiated (or reused) for every hub invocation, but a single hub invocation could trigger \"countless\" `IClientFilter` executions when using `All` or `Except`.\r\nRegardless, the engineer should have the possibility to weight pros and cons of adding such a code to his application. Perhaps the performance cost is worth the results.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n`IClientFilter` could have a single method:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface IClientFilter {\r\n    ValueTask OnSendAsync(ClientInvocationContext context,  Func\u003cClientInvocationContext, ValueTask\u003e next);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd be added to `HubOptions` the same way a `IHubFilter` is:\r\n```csharp\r\nservices.AddSingalR(options =\u003e {\r\n    options.AddClientFilter\u003cMyFilter\u003e();\r\n    options.AddClientFilter(typeof(MyFilter));\r\n    options.AddClientFilter(new MyFilter());\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: We could not simply use `AddFilter` because it would collide with the current `AddFilter(Type)` used for `IHubFilter`s.\r\n\r\nFrom here, each time a message is to be sent to a client, the method `OnSendAsync` would be invoked as a middleware.\r\nIf an exception occur (much like happens with `IHubFilter.InvokeMethodAsync`, the message would not be sent.\r\nMessages sent from outside the hub instance, using `IHubContext` should behave the same way.\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\n# Detailed design\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s often best not to fill this out until you get basic consensus about the above. When you do, consider adding an implementation proposal with the following headings:\r\n\r\nDetailed design\r\nDrawbacks\r\nConsidered alternatives\r\nOpen questions\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nIf there\u0027s one clear design you have consensus on, you could do that directly in a PR.\r\n--\u003e\r\n",

For instance, `Clients.All` would share the same instance for all clients targeted for the message.\r\n    // the rest would be pretty much the same as a `HubInvocationContext` with a few name changes\r\n    public string MethodName { get; }\r\n    public IReadOnlyList\u003cobject?\u003e MethodArguments { get; }\r\n    public IServiceProvider ServiceProvider { get; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe part in the code where things diverge a little is inside `HubConnectionHandler`. Here the filters would be sent to `HubConnectionContext` during `HubConnectionHandler.OnConnectedAsync` using the `HubConnectionContextOptions`.\r\n\r\nOn the constructor, we build the middleware invokation (much like the `DefaultHubDispatcher` does for `IHibFilters`) and \"intercept\" calls to both `HubConnectionContext.WriteAsync` methods.\r\n\r\nTo preserve performance when no filters are declared, we \"short circuit\" the call (again like the dispatcher does) and keep things running as usual.\r\n\r\nWhen either method is called we\u0027d have to check:\r\n* if a middleware exists; and\r\n* if the message is a `HubMethodInvocationMessages`.\r\n\r\nIf both are true, we\u0027d create a `ClientInvocationContext` using either a `HubMessage` or `SerializedHubMessage` (using different internal constructors to preserve cache functionality) and call the middleware.\r\n\r\nThe hub instance may be a complication here because the connection instance lives way longer then the hub instances and it is not practical to keep one for each connection/handler.\r\nTo solve this, I think we could pass the hub instance with the `WriteAsync` call, but that may break compatibility.",

When integrate testing my backend I found the difference between c# and js clients, wich lead me to false positives tests.\r\n\r\n## In scope\r\n\r\nThe proposal here is to make all clients case insensitive when registering a handler, that way, we can expect all clients to behave the same way.\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\n\r\nThe idea is to be more flexible, so making them all case sensitive is out of scope.\r\n\r\n## Risks / unknowns\r\n\r\nDespite being more flexible, I believe in some edge cases, we may have older clients registering both handlers to match casing.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nNo matter what SignalR Client my hub client decides to use, I expect the same behavior.\r\nThe following declarations should be about the same invocation:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// C#\r\nconnection.On(\"MyMethod\", MyMethodHandler);\r\nconnection.On(\"mymethod\", MyMethodHandler);\r\n```\r\n```cpp\r\n//Java\r\nconnection.on(\"MyMethod\", myMethodHandler);\r\nconnection.on(\"mymethod\", myMethodHandler);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current Implementations\r\n\r\nThe Javascript client, register the handlers with lower case target name:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/239b00d00cb271ab3719ef3843570727778c11f6/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts#L468\r\n\r\nThe C++ client uses an unordered map with case insensitive comparers:\r\nhttps://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-Client-Cpp/blob/facb478884450ee805a21e8e794dec4c156e3a11/src/signalrclient/hub_connection_impl.h#L59\r\n\r\nThe Java client uses a hash map:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/239b00d00cb271ab3719ef3843570727778c11f6/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/CallbackMap.java#L14\r\n\r\nAnd the C# client uses a concurrent dictionary with ordinal string comparer:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/239b00d00cb271ab3719ef3843570727778c11f6/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Client.Core/src/HubConnection.cs#L78\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\n# Detailed design\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s often best not to fill this out until you get basic consensus about the above.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI am using SignalR infrastructure with Redis backplane. Since projects are part of the same solution, the most efficient way (code-wise) is to have the specific hub\u0027s class implementation shared between the various components. The problem is that this class has to contain certain implementation or reference(s) to other components within the solution, which aren\u0027t needed or can\u0027t be shared with all hub\u0027s using parties. That leads to the necessity to copy\u0026paste the hub class\u0027 definition on multiple projects within the solution, under the same namespace. That leads to compile-time warnings as the (hub) class defined on one project overlaps with the (hub) class on another one. \n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nOne way to deal with the problem is to modify this part:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/240377059ec25b4d9d86d4188a26722e55edc5a1/src/SignalR/server/StackExchangeRedis/src/RedisHubLifetimeManager.cs#L74\r\n\r\nInstead of always using the hub class\u0027 FullName to form the Redis prefix for the channel, to have a way to override it via options. This would allow different Hub classes (containing their specific implementation needs) to communicate without the need of class name overlapping.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI\u0027ll try to be more precise about my actual issue. I need to use the hub to interface a front-end application (Angular based). Some activities that are started via the front-end (through a hub class that\u0027s part of an ASP Core web application) are completed on back-end instances. Those back-end instances must have a way to notify the caller or broadcast the result of the back-end handled operation to interested parties. Therefore I need two quite different hub class implementations - one to be integrated on the web infrastructure, which only knows how to trigger an operation and another one, for the back-end components that have very different dependency requirements to be able to push notifications to the hub-connected clients. I had already achieved it by using the same hub class name and suppressed the compile time CS0436 warnings, but that seems flimsy.",

Github also doesn\u0027t support diffing between versions for a specific directory. The closest you could get is manually looking at the commits from two releases.\r\ne.g. https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commits/release/7.0/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commits/release/8.0/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr\r\nLooks like there were ~13 commits to the @microsoft/signalr project between 7.0 and 8.0",

I would like to update a typescript client app and I struggled to find some info about what is changed between 7 and 8... Breaking changes? It\u0027s safe to upgrade? What is the migration process? What should I test? and so on. Very very bad DX. It\u0027s a standard for each npm package to point to a changelog/release note. If you want JavaScript/typescript to embrace signalr this is a minimum level of info to provide. I cannot spend hours every time I need to upgrade, not only for major versions, but also for bug fix and minor changes. I expect a little bit more from Microsoft to be honest. \r\nOr is signalr been deprecated and we need to look to something else? Because the message you send out is exactly this: **we don\u0027t have time to support this package**.",

Using the \"AddNewtonsoftJsonProtocol\" extension method from Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.NewtonsoftJsonProtocolDependencyInjectionExtensions and setting options.PayloadSerializerSettings.MaxDepth to a higher value - this is not respected\r\n2. Implementing IConfigureOptions\u003cNewtonsoftJsonHubProtocolOptions\u003e in a custom class and setting options.PayloadSerializerSettings.MaxDepth to a higher value from inside the void Configure(NewtonsoftJsonHubProtocolOptions) method. Of course, also did the .ConfigureOptions\u003cMyCustomOptions\u003e on the IServiceCollection in ConfigureServices method of my Startup.cs\r\n3. I also got desperate and tried to do ` JsonConvert.DefaultSettings = () =\u003e new JsonSerializerSettings { MaxDepth = 256 };` to use directly newtonsoft in the hope that it will respect the global default settings factory. Still no luck.\r\n\r\nAll my attempts ended up with the exact same error, complaining about the max depth of 64 being reached, and this causes my signalR connection to drop.\r\n\r\nPlease help with either providing the proper way to override that configuration, or help with a workaround (for example, is there a way to prevent signalR from deserializing my parameter, obtain somehow the raw content, and let my code handle the deserialization explicitly, in which case I can control the deserialization settings inline?\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, in the NewtonsoftJsonHubProtocol method ParseMessage, when doing the JArray.Load it does indeed seem like the PayloadSerializer member is not used. Please evaluate if this is right. (there might be other places, not just JArray handling, but this is the one that is a match for my scenario, according to the stack trace too)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect to be able to change the value of MaxDepth used by the deserializer when handling the signalR messages so that I am not stuck with the default depth of 64 on the Newtonsoft Json protocol.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\nSet up a project with SignalR and NewtonsoftJsonProtocol.\r\nSend a message from the client to the server with an object that has more than 64 levels of nesting. - expected to have it fail and disconnect.\r\nNow try to change the MaxDepth configuration on the protocol - it will still fail with the same error - that the MaxDepth of 64 was reached\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n```\r\nClient disconnected.

Bidirectional tracing is useful in scenario\u0027s like IoT devices with local intelligent hubs plus cloud (a project I am working on). Or like in [this chat app example trace](https://twitter.com/vincenth_net/status/1747214763996672337), 2 app instances connected to the cloud backend with SignalR. It is helpful to see the true end2end flow and timings.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Wrote the test but didn\u0027t know how to execute it except by creating a Pullrequest... Also not sure if my log line really works because it is nullable until build()\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\ncalling withUrl() second time without the optional parameter will not overwrite transport from LongPolling with undefined\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/51875\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n\"@microsoft/signalr\": \"^7.0.5\",\n\n### Anything else?\n\nIn debug logging I receive this unexpected logging:\r\nDebug: Selecting transport \u0027WebSockets\u0027.\r\n-\u003e altough I\u0027ve selected LongPolling on first withUrl() call and didn\u0027t specify it in second withUrl call",

So the question is whether there is a way to access `HubCallerContext` or at least `ClaimsPrincipal` through a service outside of a Hub?\r\n\r\nThe only related info I could find is the following comment from @analogrelay ([here is the link to it](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/12535#issuecomment-514900103)):\r\n\r\n\u003e This is by design. There is no active HTTP request in your application when using Azure SignalR.\r\nIf what you\u0027re trying to do is access claims on the user, those should have been copied over to the HubCallerContext.User property (accessible via the Context property on your Hub).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAll Android apps with updated tooling will now use R8 full mode. I do however find it odd that this issue is only occuring for me but I\u0027ll post it here and see whether it gets upvoted or not.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:**\r\nMinified app does not get SignalR messages. Reason seems to be the class com.microsoft.signalr.HandshakeResponseMessage.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSolution is to add the following to either your app\u0027s proguard file or if you have a more module heavy project like I do, add it to your consumer file:\r\n`-keepclassmembers class com.microsoft.signalr.HandshakeResponseMessage`\r\n\r\nThis could of coarse be me doing something wrong but keeping the class members of this particular class works and I can\u0027t find any proguard rules in this repository for the java client or when inspecting the library files.\r\n\r\nThe rule can likely be more specific and the SignalR client is still quite new to me but figured there must be someone else out there struggling with this 😅\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nAndroid project with minification enabled that subscribes to some SignalR channel.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nNone actually. This was a very frustrating thing to figure out as the issue was silent.\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\nSignalR java client versions tested: 8.0.0, 7.0.0 and 7.0.14\r\nAndroid Gradle Plugin: 8.1.4",

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nShort version: consider integrating with https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/pull/2498/ (when deployed) to exploit `SSUBSCRIBE`/`SPUBLISH` when appropriate\r\n\r\nJustification: overall system performance by reducing overheads in redis-cluster (no client-specific performance impact, but the reduced server load should measurably improve overall system throughput - especially in large clusters and where multiple channels are in use, since the number of server-to-server connections is super-linear vs node count)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSignalR on redis makes extensive use of `SUBSCRIBE` / `PUBLISH`; on redis vanilla, that is simple, but in \"cluster\" mode (for highly scalable or redundant environments), these operate in a simple scatter/web mode - which is to say: a subscriber can connect to any server, and a publisher can publish on any server - the server will use inter-node gossip to route the messages everywhere. This is simple and easy, but has additional overheads:\r\n\r\n- lots of inter-server communication to get data everywhere\r\n- possible unnecessary delays and ordering concerns\r\n\r\nThese overheads seem directly relevant to high throughput SignalR scenarios.\r\n\r\nTo reduce these overheads, Redis 7 adds [`SSUBSCRIBE`](https://redis.io/commands/ssubscribe/) and [`SPUBLISH`](https://redis.io/commands/spublish/) - the sharded variant of pub/sub - *without* chaos mode. This means that clients need to subscribe and publish using standard routing. Because of the risk of undelivered messages, and the fact that it is Redis 7 only: even though SE.Redis *already* routes using the channel, we do not default to `SSUBSCRIBE` / `SPUBLISH`.\r\n\r\nSupport for this feature is added in https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/pull/2498/ ; note that you should ideally use configuration and/or feature detection (it has been added to the features API) and switch between `RedisChannel.Literal` and `RedisChannel.Sharded`.\r\n\r\nNote also that there is a migration caveat: if migrating to enable the use of sharded, then in a hybrid app-cluster (i.e. some nodes updated, some not), the nodes using shaded vs vanilla usage might not cooperate nicely\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\n\r\nconsider using the new API when available\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n1. note that *pattern* (glob, wildcard, etc) channel subscriptions cannot be sharded; they *must* use the web/chaos mode\r\n2. note that `SPUBLISH`/`SSUBSCRIBE` require either a server capability test or an enable/disable toggle (either server-version based, or by attempting `SPUBLISH {random guid} {whatever}` and observing `-ERR unknown command \u0027spublish\u0027`)\r\n3. note that `SPUBLISH`/`SSUBSCRIBE` are fine to use on standalone (non-cluster) redis\r\n4. note that `SPUBLISH` and `PUBLISH` are effectively isolated; a client connecting via `SUBSCRIBE foo` *will not* get a message published via `SPUBLISH foo bar`, etc; this means that nodes in an application must agree on the strategy being used\r\n\r\nSide note: since this requires a lib bump, you might *also* want to consider whether enabling RESP3 is appropriate; RESP3 halves the number of sockets required for pub/sub environments; see [RESP3 and StackExchange.Redis](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Resp3) for more info including necessary considerations",

The state is maintained in memory on the server side. If it is retained, it cannot be stored in external resources such as DB or Redis.If the state is retained in server memory and it takes time to change the SignalR implementation, is it possible to monitor whether SignalR is connected? With AzureMonitor etc.If connection monitoring is possible, I think it would be possible to temporarily disconnect SignalR with SSR and scale in when there is no SignalR connection.",

From looking into ts client sources it seems that it is a client that closes SSE connection\r\n\r\n- `HubConnection.stop() -\u003e HubConnection._stopInternal() =\u003e HttpConnection.stop() -\u003e HttpConnection._stopInternal() =\u003e ServerSentEventsTransport.stop() -\u003e ServerSentEventsTransport._close() `\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8486d31e24f30e3fa1809a95699a0adc16f448d7/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/ServerSentEventsTransport.ts#L121\r\n\r\nNow the issue seems to be a race-condition/not awaiting `_sendCloseMessage()` in `HubConnection._stopInternal() `\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/8486d31e24f30e3fa1809a95699a0adc16f448d7/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts#L345\r\n\r\n\r\nI will try to build custom client/reproduce it reliably using some network limiting in a browser.\r\nI don\u0027t know what a proper solution should be. There is intentional comment/eslint to not await a close message. Also it does not feel right to have two \"independent\" methods to do conceptually the same thing.\r\n",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI was running a Flutter app that uses on its android side the signalr java client.\r\nIn the android side (the java client), I listen to the [onClosed](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/35e82e671453ee06e5a152b5cc69e0e355d60ec6/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L856) callback from the java client to schedule automatice reconnects in my app.\r\nI was doing a heavy download on my wifi network which was taking the bandwidth from all other apps including my app mentioned above, so the [activatePingTimer](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/35e82e671453ee06e5a152b5cc69e0e355d60ec6/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L1466) method appears to have timedout and called the [private stop method](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/35e82e671453ee06e5a152b5cc69e0e355d60ec6/src/SignalR/clients/java/signalr/core/src/main/java/com/microsoft/signalr/HubConnection.java#L1473C29-L1473C105).\r\nThe problem is that this private `stop` method, does not call the `onClosed` callback registered by my app, so my app never knew the connection was closed so that it can reschedule an auto-reconnect.\r\nI know that the `onClosed` callback is documented as \r\n\u003e Registers a callback to run when the connection is closed.\r\n\r\nBut does not this case indicate that connection is closed?\r\nIf this is a bug, then the private `stop` method should call the `onClosed` callbacks.\r\nElse if this is how its intended to work, then can you provide a way to listen to when the connection stops? \r\n(Whats the difference anyway between \"stop\" and \"close\", other than that \"close\" disposes the resources associated with the object?)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps

The \"Hub\" would look similar to a Group in Minimal APIs and the endpoints look similar to `MapGet`, `MapPost`, etc. with a user provided delegate that is interpreted by something like RequestDelegateFactory (HubDelegateFactory?).\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar myHub = app.MapHubName(\"/myHub\");\r\nmyHub.Map(\"Echo\", (string message) =\u003e message);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome interesting aspects to note:\r\n* There is no user provided `Hub` type any more\r\n  - Should we allow mixing with a `Hub`? `var myHub = app.MapHubName\u003cOtherHub\u003e(\"/myHub\");` First instinct is no.\r\n  - Technically this would allow libraries to add methods to a Hub\r\n* `IHubContext` would need to be accessed via KeyedDI for background services/other app code\r\n  - `[KeyedService(\"myHub\")] IHubContext`\r\n* Properties from the `Hub` will need to be automatically injected into user delegates\r\n  - Sadly less discoverable than `Hub` where you can just access `this.Context` etc.\r\n  - `IHubCallerClients`, `HubCallerContext`, `IGroupManager`\r\n  - `IHubContext` could also be automatically injected without using `KeyedService` if we wanted\r\n* In the example below I show a new hub filter type that is similar to `AddEndpointFilter` where you can add it to a specific API call instead of the entire `Hub`. Seems like an optional feature we can add regardless of \"Minimal Hubs\"\r\n\r\nExample program showing some of the ways you can do things:\r\n```csharp\r\n// Can apply endpoint metadata like usual\r\nvar hub = app.MapHubName(\"/myHub\")\r\n    .AddMessagePackProtocol()\r\n    .AddStackExchangeRedis()\r\n    .RequireAuthorization()\r\n    .AddFilter\u003cMyHubFilter\u003e();\r\n\r\nvar logger = app.Services.GetService\u003cILogger\u003e();\r\n\r\nhub.Map(\"Broadcast\", async (string message, IHubCallerClients clients) =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    await clients.All.SendAsync(\"Broadcast\", message);\r\n});\r\n\r\nhub.Map(\"EchoV1\", (string message) =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    // :O captured variable\r\n    logger.LogInformation(\"Echo {Message}\", message);\r\n    return message;\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Auto-inject IHubCallerClients and HubCallerContext\r\n// Less discoverable than having a strongly typed Hub where they are just properties on the class\r\nhub.Map(\"EchoV2\", async (string message, IHubCallerClients clients, HubCallerContext self) =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    await clients.Client(self.ConnectionId).SendAsync(\"Echo\", message);\r\n});\r\n\r\nhub.Map(\"Add\", (int x, int y, ILogger injectedLogger) =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    injectedLogger.LogInformation(\"Adding {X} and {Y}\", x, y);\r\n    return x + y;\r\n}).AddFilter(context =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    // This is a completely different filter from what we have today. The way its written it\u0027s input only and method specific. Just a thought experiment.\r\n    context.Arguments[0] = 10;\r\n});\r\n\r\n// KeyedService automatically created and named based on MapHubName. We could also automatically deduce this is IHubContext from \"myHub\" because of the builder type.\r\n// But it shows how someone could reference this IHubContext from other areas of the code (since there isn\u0027t a Hub type).\r\nhub.Map(\"hubContext\", async ([KeyedService(\"myHub\")] IHubContext hubContext) =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    await hubContext.Clients.All.SendAsync(\"Echo\", \"test\");\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.Run();\r\n```",

Please describe the problem.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIn the docs, it\u0027s recommended to refresh the accessToken within the AccessTokenFactory method. However, I have noticed that this method is called with every SignalR connection, regardless of the reason why that connection was required.\r\n\r\nIf this is an expensive (aka serverside) operation, it doesn\u0027t make sense to refresh the accessToken every time. Imagine a client with patchy internet having to reconnect, and that yielding an additional and unnecessary token refresh. Not only from the client\u0027s perspective, also in terms of server load, and latency for all clients on first connection.\r\n\r\nInstead, the accessToken should be cached until there is specifically a 401 exception, at which point it should be refreshed. At least there should be an option to do this. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, an optional boolean property could be passed into the AccessTokenFactory indicating whether the previous token has been found to be in valid.\r\n\r\nEither that, or it should be possible to catch 401 exceptions specifically on the HubConnection, which could in turn be configured to trigger a token refresh. Right now, the exception is simply plaintext. Perhaps adding a status code property would be enough.\r\n\r\nIn general, errors on the HubConnection are not possible to catch. The \u0027onclose\u0027 doesn\u0027t fire in case of all errors, so it\u0027s not the correct place for that, and there is no equivalent \u0027onerror\u0027. One way to fix this would be to add an \u0027onerror\u0027 event which includes the status code as part of the error.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn the Browser/TypeScript SignalR client, the Server-Sent Event (SSE) keep alive ping fails to renew the access token (it fails to perform the existing retry logic and call the access token factory again) if a 401 Unauthorised happens on the ping.\r\n\r\nThis doesn\u0027t just affect the SSE ping... Similarly, when Long Polling connections are being reissued after they timeout, this same issue causes the Long Polling to unnecessarily go through a longer lifecycle where is  \u0027completes\u0027 / sets this._running to false and closes by calling this.raiseOnClose() - instead of a shorter lifecycle that keeps the _poll function looping in a running state.\r\n\r\nWhen an SSE keep alive ping happens (for example), AccessTokenHttpClient calls `this._innerClient` to send a request.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/94259788d58e16ba753900b4bf855a6aee08dcb1/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/AccessTokenHttpClient.ts#L28\r\n\r\nThen FetchHttpClient throws an HttpError if the response is not Ok.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/250b489a34b6c01509ed24b18b47b082d8ba4744/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/FetchHttpClient.ts#L125\r\n\r\nAnd there be the problem, because that HttpError is not caught anywhere, so the existing retry logic in AccessTokenHttpClient is prevented from inspecting the response.statusCode for a 401 Unauthorized and performing a retry to get a new access token.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/94259788d58e16ba753900b4bf855a6aee08dcb1/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/AccessTokenHttpClient.ts#L30\r\n\r\n```\r\n        const response = await this._innerClient.send(request);    // FetchHttpClient THROWS IN HERE\r\n\r\n        // SO THIS NEVER EXECUTES:\r\n        if (allowRetry \u0026\u0026 response.statusCode === 401 \u0026\u0026 this._accessTokenFactory) {\r\n            this._accessToken = await this._accessTokenFactory();\r\n            this._setAuthorizationHeader(request);\r\n            return await this._innerClient.send(request);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that it is existing retry logic that is not working as intended, I think this is a bug.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe existing retry code should execute as apparently intended and call the access token factory. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Set up a hub connection (using the TypeScript client in a browser which has fetch available) with the option `transport: HttpTransportType.ServerSentEvents,` \r\n2. Have a bearer access token with a lifetime shorter than the keep alive ping (or ensure that the ping will return a 401 Unauthorized)\r\n3. Let it run and wait for the keep alive ping to happen\r\n4. When the ping happens and a 401 is returned, the retry logic in AccessTokenHttpClient.ts does not execute because an HttpError is thrown \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/94259788d58e16ba753900b4bf855a6aee08dcb1/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/AccessTokenHttpClient.ts#L30\r\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nHttpError thrown by FetchHttpClient \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/250b489a34b6c01509ed24b18b47b082d8ba4744/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/FetchHttpClient.ts#L125\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.302\n\n### Anything else?\n\n\"@microsoft/signalr\": \"^8.0.0\",\r\n\r\nI see https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/5297 is somewhat related - not sure if that will change the logic or the  intended approach.\r\n",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI am trying to handle WebSocket disconnections reliably in my SignalR client. However, the current implementation of the [WebSocketTransport](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/9518cf2c2152b9406efccd928d90e67793065dbe/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/WebSocketTransport.ts#L177) in the SignalR TypeScript client SDK does not pass the `closeEvent.code` to the consumer. This makes it difficult to distinguish between different types of disconnections and act accordingly, as the essential information provided by the WebSocket close event code is not accessible.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI propose introducing a new error type, `WebSocketError`, which extends the `Error` class. This error should capture the `wasClean` and code fields from the `closeEvent`, similar to how the SDK currently handles `HttpError` in [Errors.ts](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/9518cf2c2152b9406efccd928d90e67793065dbe/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/Errors.ts#L7) . This would allow consumers of the SDK to access these fields and handle WebSocket disconnections based on the specific close event code.\n\n### Additional context\n\n\r\nYou can find the current implementation in the following code references:\r\n- [WebSocketTransport.ts](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/9518cf2c2152b9406efccd928d90e67793065dbe/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/WebSocketTransport.ts#L176)\r\n- [HttpError in Errors.ts](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/9518cf2c2152b9406efccd928d90e67793065dbe/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/Errors.ts#L7)\r\n",

Unless the HubConnection instance is disposed and rebuilt.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCalling `hubConnection.start()` should let the client become `Connected` state as soon as possible, while calling `hubConnection.stop()` should let the client become `Disconnected` state as soon as possible.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```ts\r\nimport { HubConnection, HubConnectionBuilder, HubConnectionState, LogLevel } from \"@microsoft/signalr\";\r\n\r\nvar hubConnection: HubConnection;\r\n\r\nhubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n                                        .withUrl(\"\u003cserver endpoint\u003e\")\r\n                                        .configureLogging(LogLevel.Information)\r\n                                        .withServerTimeout(30000)\r\n                                        .withKeepAliveInterval(15000)\r\n                                        .withStatefulReconnect()\r\n                                        .build();\r\n\r\nawait hubConnection.start();\r\n\r\nfunction checkIfHubConnected(): boolean {\r\n    return hubConnection?.state == HubConnectionState.Connected ?? false;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction hubConnectionState() {\r\n    return hubConnection?.state;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.7\n\n### Anything else?\n\npackage.json\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n   \"dependencies\": {\r\n      \"@microsoft/signalr\": \"^8.0.7\"\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```",

Instead of that, im thinking of taking the fire-and-forget approach similar to what the C# client does. Here is what im proposing:\n\n1. Update the method signatures as we discussed:\n```\npublic onclose(callback: (error?: Error) =\u003e void | Promise\u003cvoid\u003e): void;\npublic onreconnecting(callback: (error?: Error) =\u003e void | Promise\u003cvoid\u003e): void;\npublic onreconnected(callback: (connectionId?: string) =\u003e void | Promise\u003cvoid\u003e): void;\n```\n\n2. Instead of making `_completeClose` `async`, I\u0027ll keep it sync and use a seperate `_runCloseCallbacks` function to handle both sync and async callbacks. This way, we dont need to worry about changing all the call sites:\n\n```\nprivate _completeClose(error?: Error): void {\n    if (this._connectionStarted) {\n        this._connectionState = HubConnectionState.Disconnected;\n        this._connectionStarted = false;\n        if (this._messageBuffer) {\n            this._messageBuffer._dispose(error ?? new Error(\"Connection closed.\"));\n            this._messageBuffer = undefined;\n        }\n\n        if (Platform.isBrowser) {\n            window.document.removeEventListener(\"freeze\", this._freezeEventListener);\n        }\n\n        // Fire-and-forget the callbacks\n        this._runCloseCallbacks(error);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate async _runCloseCallbacks(error?: Error): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    try {\n        for (const callback of this._closedCallbacks) {\n            await callback(error); // Await both sync and async callbacks\n        }\n    } catch (e) {\n        this._logger.log(LogLevel.Error, `An onclose callback called with error \u0027${error}\u0027 threw error \u0027${e}\u0027.`);\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd also do the same for `reconnecting` and `reconnected` callbacks.\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/80ac2ff6a4e223eb5a91112912dc5d53c093d47f/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts#L891-L896\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/80ac2ff6a4e223eb5a91112912dc5d53c093d47f/src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts#L924-L928\n\nLet me know if this looks good, and I’ll go ahead and submit the PR.",

        "body":  "**Background and Motivation**\nWhen using the @microsoft/signalr library with WebSocket transport in Safari, the connection randomly disconnects after 15-20 minutes of inactivity when the user switches tabs or stops interacting with the browser. This behavior is inconsistent with other browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), where the connection remains stable under similar conditions.\n\nUpon investigation, I found that the WebSocket error handler in the library (webSocket.onerror) logs errors at the Information level and provides minimal information about the issue, making it difficult to identify the root cause. Furthermore, the library does not provide detailed error-handling logic to manage such WebSocket errors effectively or to implement custom reconnection strategies when these errors occur.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\n- Set up a SignalR connection using the @microsoft/signalr library with WebSocket transport.\n- Use the Safari browser and open a page that connects via SignalR.\n- Switch tabs or leave the browser inactive for 15-20 minutes.\n- Observe that the connection gets closed without detailed error information.\n\n**Environment**\n\n- Library version: @microsoft/signalr version 6.0.25\n- Browser: Safari (Version 17.6)\n- OS: macOS (Version 14.6.1)\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n\n- Improve the logging mechanism for WebSocket errors by including more details (e.g., WebSocket status, error type) and logging at a higher severity level (e.g., Error).\n- Expose the internal WebSocket instance or provide a way to attach custom event handlers (onerror, onclose) for better control over connection management.\n- Review the reconnection strategy in scenarios where Safari or other browsers close the WebSocket due to inactivity or tab suspension.\n\n**Proposed API**\n_Expected Behavior_\n\n- The library should provide more detailed error logging and allow users to access the internal WebSocket instance to add custom error handling.\n- Errors should be logged at a higher level (e.g., Error) to make them visible and actionable.\n- A mechanism should be available to manage WebSocket errors more robustly, particularly in browsers known for connection stability issues.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```\nwebSocket.onerror = (event: Event) =\u003e {\n    let error: any = null;\n    // ErrorEvent is a browser-only type; we need to check if the type exists before using it\n    if (typeof ErrorEvent !== \"undefined\" \u0026\u0026 event instanceof ErrorEvent) {\n        error = event.error;\n    } else {\n        error = \"There was an error with the transport\";\n    }\n    this._logger.log(LogLevel.Information, `(WebSockets transport) ${error}.`);\n};\n```\n\n\nThere is no built-in support for custom error handling for WebSocket errors, making it difficult to implement a solution that works across different browsers.\n\n**Usage Examples**\n\n```\nimport { HubConnectionBuilder, LogLevel, HttpTransportType } from \"@microsoft/signalr\";\n\n// Custom error handler\nfunction handleWebSocketError(error) {\n    console.error(\"Custom WebSocket error handler:\", error);\n    // Custom logic to handle errors, such as reconnecting or logging details\n}\n\n// Custom reconnection handler\nfunction handleReconnection(attempt) {\n    console.log(`Reconnection attempt #${attempt}`);\n    // Custom logic for reconnection attempts, such as increasing delay intervals\n}\n\n// Create the connection\nconst connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\n    .withUrl(\"/hub\", {\n        transport: HttpTransportType.WebSockets,\n        errorHandler: handleWebSocketError, // Using the new error handler option\n        reconnectionHandler: handleReconnection, // Using the new reconnection handler option\n    })\n    .configureLogging(LogLevel.Information)\n    .withAutomaticReconnect()\n    .build();\n\n// Start the connection\nconnection.start().then(() =\u003e {\n    console.log(\"Connection started!\");\n}).catch((err) =\u003e {\n    console.error(\"Failed to start connection:\", err);\n});\n```\n\nThank you for considering this issue!\n",

Our application, whenever there  is at least one client connected needs 30 seconds from when the Asp.NET core receve the IsClosing from when the app is closed.\n\nThis is really annoying because we have software running as windows service, and having this long timeout sometimes generates problem.\n\nWe took the timing with IHostedLifecycleService and whenever there is a client connected the time between closing and closed is always 30 seconds (with a difference of max 100 milliseconds). \n\nWe are using version 8.0.5, and issue [#53165](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/53165) is closed so I\u0027m expecting not to have this problem. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen I shutdown my asp.net core application I do not want signalr block the shutdown for 30 seconds, because it causes problem.\n\nI\u0027m expecting also the possibility to force signalr to close everything and letting the application shutdown correctly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI do not have a minimal reproduction, it happens always on our software.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.404\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

The root cause is that when the app starts shutting down it triggers `ApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStopping` token which SignalR listens to and uses to close it\u0027s connections. Kestrel then runs and unbinds its connection listeners, but if there are new SignalR connections between when SignalR closes its connections and Kestrel unbinds the connection listener, those connections will succeed and block Kestrel finishing the close logic until the host timeout when it aborts the connections.\n\nFrom your logs, it looks like immediately after the shutdown starts a new connection comes in. Likely because your clients have reconnection logic to retry immediately on close. A possible workaround (if you own the client code) is to make them wait a short amount of time before reconnection.\n```\n[10:01:39 DBG][Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host] Hosting stopping \u003c--- shutdown starts\n[10:01:39 DBG][Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2] Trace id \"0HN8QHE8EU5UM:00000013\": HTTP/2 stream error \"\"INTERNAL_ERROR\"\".

The root cause is that when the app\r\n\u003e starts shutting down it triggers ApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStopping\r\n\u003e token which SignalR listens to and uses to close it\u0027s connections. Kestrel\r\n\u003e then runs and unbinds its connection listeners, but if there are new\r\n\u003e SignalR connections between when SignalR closes its connections and Kestrel\r\n\u003e unbinds the connection listener, those connections will succeed and block\r\n\u003e Kestrel finishing the close logic until the host timeout when it aborts the\r\n\u003e connections.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e From your logs, it looks like immediately after the shutdown starts a new\r\n\u003e connection comes in. Likely because your clients have reconnection logic to\r\n\u003e retry immediately on close. A possible workaround (if you own the client\r\n\u003e code) is to make them wait a short amount of time before reconnection.\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003e [10:01:39 DBG][Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host] Hosting stopping \u003c--- shutdown starts\r\n\u003e [10:01:39 DBG][Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2] Trace id \"0HN8QHE8EU5UM:00000013\": HTTP/2 stream error \"\"INTERNAL_ERROR\"\".

Enhance Telemetry:\n - Provide detailed telemetry for these failure points, including method resolution errors, type mismatches, and parameter issues. this would enable devs to monitor such events externally without affecting SignalR\u0027s internal flow.\n\n3.

We currently try with the same “userId” and “IP”. I am wondering if it is valuable to append some “correlationid” to a HubConnection in the client SDK by default, so that we could track the lifetime of the HubConnection when it re-starts? It could also be used to correlate the negotiate request to the app server with the negotiate/connect request to the SignalR service.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

There is code specifically included where when the payload size is too big, that it throws the signal r exception. Why would it be difficult to either allow us via a public property to view the size or just simply return the size within the exception. That would allow us to accurately scale the payload size up or down. \n\nAt the point you throw that exception you have the size which you\u0027ve determined is invalid.

Which is already included in the exception message, and it\u0027s also available in the `HubOptions`. As I described above, `buffer.Length` is not guaranteed to be a meaningful value here, so isn\u0027t a good candidate to expose.",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI am integrating SignalR into my React code. Currently, there is no way to listen to all connection state changes. \nA workaround I found is to use `onclose`, `onreconnecting` and `onreconnected`. However, there is no way to unsubscribe from these events.\n\nOn the client code, I preserve and reuse the connection instance. When a component needs to access the SignalR connection, it will get the same connection instance if one has already been created, and then subscribe to the changes. \nWhen the component unmounts, it has no way to unsubscribe so the stale handlers are stuck in the connection instance(`this._closedCallbacks`, `this._reconnectingCallbacks`, and `this._reconnectedCallbacks`). When the component is remounted, new handlers are added. This causes memory leak on the client side.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n- Add a way to unsubscribe from connection status change events. For example,\n    - Returns the unsubscribe function when calling `onclose`, `onreconnecting`, and `onreconnected` (Preferred, the consumer doesn\u0027t have to cache the callback reference manually).\n    - Or provides `offclose`, `offreconnecting`, and `offreconnected` (the naming can be changed).\n- Or add a new method `onConnectionStateChange` which will be fired every time `this._connectionState` changes and do one of the following,\n    - Returns the unsubscribe function (Preferred, the consumer doesn\u0027t have to cache the callback reference manually).\n    - Or provides `offConnectionStateChange` (the naming can be changed).\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe issue can be addressed by updating this file `src/SignalR/clients/ts/signalr/src/HubConnection.ts`",

SignalR\u0027s expectation is to stop() a connection and then set the connection = null to mark it for gc (includes callbacks). Honestly though, I think it depends on your use-case and what you\u0027re trying to do. If you can provide more information, perhaps we can brainstorm a solution.\n\nIn my previous cases, I used it for a chat lobby service. I wrapped the connection in a chat service and managed my own subscriptions to Subjects (rxjs). This allowed me to do things (within my app) like browse to another page temporarily while remaining connected to the chat lobby, then clicking a link back into the lobby with all the content that happened while I was gone. My chat lobby components only needed to subscribe/unsubscribe from the chat service events, not the hubconnection itself.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWe have a Net 4 winform providing a bridge between browsers and Windows TWAIN scanners.  It was migrated to Net Core and now the negotiate fails.  Research suggests this is because there is no compatibility option between Core and Net 4 SignalR servers and clients.  The impact is that it is not possible to update either the SignalR server or client without requiring a reinstall of the winform bridging component across the entire customer base.  This is a huge logistical issue.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nProvide a Net 4 SignalR compatibility mode for Core, or describe how Core can be configured for compatibility.\n\n### Additional context\n\nTrace:\n\nDebug: 2025-01-03 09:22:25.757 1 candidate(s) found for the request path \u0027/s/negotiate\u0027\nDebug: 2025-01-03 09:22:25.758 Request matched endpoint \u0027/s/negotiate\u0027\nDebug: 2025-01-03 09:22:25.760 The maximum request body size has been set to 104857600.\nInformation: 2025-01-03 09:22:25.761 Executing endpoint \u0027/s/negotiate\u0027\nInformation: 2025-01-03 09:22:25.763 Executed endpoint \u0027/s/negotiate\u0027\nInformation: 2025-01-03 09:22:25.764 Request finished HTTP/2 GET https://localhost:59754/s/negotiate?clientProtocol=2.1\u0026connectionData=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22s%22%7D%5D\u0026_=1735912793367 - 405 0 text/plain 14.2070ms",

Please describe the problem.\n\nCurrently, when SendUsersAsync is called in DefaultHubLifetimeManager, it performs a full iteration over the ConcurrentDictionary, checking all connections instead of retrieving the data in O(1) time complexity.\n\nThis can lead to performance issues as the iteration scales poorly with the number of connections. Moreover, this behavior is not intuitive, since other hub lifetime managers, such as RedisHubLifetimeManager, create separate channels for each user instead of storing all users under a single key and performing a full scan.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI propose adding a separate dictionary to store connections by userId, similar to how groups and connections are already managed:\n`private readonly HubConnectionStore _connections = new HubConnectionStore();\nprivate readonly HubGroupList _groups = new HubGroupList();`\nThis would allow direct access to user connections in O(1) time, significantly improving performance, especially in high-load scenarios.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe current approach affects performance when scaling large SignalR applications.\nRedisHubLifetimeManager already follows a per-user channel approach, making it more efficient.\nIntroducing a userId-based dictionary would align the behavior of DefaultHubLifetimeManager with RedisHubLifetimeManager, making the API more consistent.",

The default behavior for the `NegotiationResponse` type assumes its serialized in a specific way, where properties are ignored if they\u0027re `null`, this is not the default behavior, however; of the `System.Text.Json` serializer for both `JsonSerializerDefaults.Web` or `JsonSeriaizerDefaults.Default`. For example, when a response is serialized as follows:\n\n```csharp\nvar response = new NegotiationResponse\n{\n    Url = \"https://example.com/signalr\",\n    AccessToken = \"fake-access-token\"\n};\n\nvar json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(\n    response,\n    new JsonSerializerOptions(JsonSerializerDefaults.Web));\n```\n\nThe resulting JSON is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"url\":\"https://example.com/signalr\",\"accessToken\":\"fake-access-token\",\"connectionId\":null,\"availableTransports\":null}\n```\n\nWhen calling `NegotiateProtocol.ParseResponse` from this JSON, theere\u0027s an exception thrown that is both misleading and inaccurate. It results in the following exception:\n\n```\nSystem.IO.InvalidDataException : Invalid negotiation response received.\n    ---- System.IO.InvalidDataException : Expected \u0027connectionId\u0027 to be of type String.\n```\n\nWhile the `connectionId` is in fact `null`, there is a `url`—which should be the only thing required when deserializing the response, per:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/f3555640d3b0d049856947c4f2bd0b869adf5c5e/src/SignalR/common/Http.Connections.Common/src/NegotiateProtocol.cs#L233\n\nAdditionally, I\u0027ve confirmed that this bug doesn\u0027t exist in the SignalR JavaScript client. See https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/playground/signalr/SignalRServerlessWeb/Pages/Index.cshtml.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the `NegotiateProtocol.ParseResponse` would either successfully deserialize the `NegotiationResponse` object, even if there are `null` properties.\n\nIdeally, client code shouldn\u0027t have to know to explicit ignore `null` properties when deserializing this type. This seems related to https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/issues/2213.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nHere\u0027s a sample xUnit project the demonstrates two tests, one that fails and

Hence filtering can be done easily server side.\n\nThose aren\u0027t the only `HubLifetimeManager` implementations. I don\u0027t think we can make a change like this without it being a breaking change.\n\nImagine you have a chat app with multiple chat rooms (represented by groups), a server admin wants to send a message to all the rooms and so they just send to every group in the app. Before, it would send a duplicate message for every group which is fine because a client might be in multiple chat rooms and see the chat message in all of them. After, the app would need to change to have a separate client method that accepted \"global\" messages or something and put all those in the UI on the client side. Effectively reversing the problem so certain apps need to duplicate the message client side instead of deduplicating the message if they wanted to.\n\nThis request is essentially a dupe of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/16908 and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14782\n\nI see in the PR that you mentioned adding a new API, that would alleviate my main concerns listed above as existing `HubLifetimeManager` implementations wouldn\u0027t need to react to this behavior change in existing methods, and app code that \"relies\" on the current behavior also wouldn\u0027t need to change.\n\n",

Thus the `IBufferWriter\u003cbyte\u003e` can\u0027t be GCed.\n\nIn the STJ internal type `Utf8JsonWriterCache` an [internal method is used to reset the output too](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/624737eb3796e1a760465912b27ac349965d8ba5/src/libraries/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Writer/Utf8JsonWriterCache.cs#L81).\n\nI\u0027m just curios if the extended lifetime is a latent problem or not.\n\nPossible mitigations could be:\n* `Dispose` -- not really, as the instance can\u0027t be re-used then\n* `Reset(Stream.Null)` -- solves the lifetime problem, but [allocates](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f29cccfec070182f8b59791881d1057293d90a1d/src/libraries/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Writer/Utf8JsonWriter.cs#L304-L308)\n* reset by setting to a null-IBufferWriter\u003cbyte\u003e (type needs to be created)\n* ?\n* make `Utf8JsonWriter.ResetAllStateForCacheReuse` `public` -- but this doesn\u0027t play nice with the disposal checks in that type\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/9607 introduced the `ReusableUtf8JsonWriter`.",

        "body":  "### Describe the bug\n\nIn writing [a Nerdbank.MessagePack implementation of `IHubProtocol`](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.MessagePack/pull/520), I\u0027ve been studying SignalR\u0027s [existing implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/common/Protocols.MessagePack/src/Protocol/MessagePackHubProtocolWorker.cs) based on MessagePack-CSharp. I\u0027ve noticed several potential issues that I will collect here for your consideration:\n\n## Real bugs\n\n1. Serialization requires knowing the declared types of arguments and return values. It is _not_ enough to simply call `object.GetType()` and serialize with that. We need to know that the parameter is typed as `BaseType` and that the argument is an instance of `DerivedType` so that `[Union]` attributes on `BaseType` can be serialized. As you have it here where the serializer relies on `GetType` on the value to be serialized, a parameter or return type declared as `BaseType` but has an instance of `DerivedType` will serialize as a \u0027naked\u0027 DerivedType. But upon **de**serialization where we _do_ have `BaseType` as a known type, the deserializer will look for a type disambiguating header to precede the `DerivedType` data. But it won\u0027t be there because `BaseType` wasn\u0027t a known type at serialization time. As a result, your SignalR implementation will fail when users try to send types with `[Union]` attributes on them. It also means my own implementation for Nerdbank.MessagePack will have the same bug, because your `IHubProtocol` interface simply doesn\u0027t make this information available.\n2. The [spec](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/SignalR/docs/specs/HubProtocol.md#messagepack-msgpack-encoding) mandates a fixed protocol version of 1. But your code currently sets it to be 2. And while your code allegedly _accepts_ a version 1 as compatible, if the version is exchanged both directions, surely your version 1 implementation on the other side will reject version 2 anyway. Am I missing something?\n\n## Other issues for your consideration\n\n1. The protocol version being part of the protocol really ought to be communicated with the `IHubProtocol` implementation. At the moment, all the protocol version evidently does is to serve as an accept/reject decision. But it would be much more useful if the `IHubProtocol` also knew which version the remote party was using so that any necessary adjustments could be made in the protocol. \n1. The message deserializing functions do not adequately guard against reading too much. While it calls `ReadArrayHeader`, most paths disregard its value and read as many elements as they want. In fact the only paths that use the return value are those that expect an _optional_ value in the array. This issue is a lower priority than it would otherwise be because the `MessagePackReader` works off of a bounded buffer so that it cannot read more than one message. So this is _ok_ for now.\n2. The message deserializing functions do not guard against reading _too little_. Typically when reading an array, you should make sure you\u0027ve read or skipped every single element in the array. Again, the fact that the top-level read function has guaranteed to have consumed the entire envelope makes this less of a manifesting bug. But it does prevent you from noticing when there\u0027s garbage at the end of a message.\n3. The schema is fundamentally incompatible with using standard serialize/deserialize functions from msgpack libraries because it mixes both the disambiguating \u0027type\u0027 integer into the same array that stores the object\u0027s fields. This makes it impossible to have each message serialize/deserialize itself, and have a higher-level method write/read the message type identifier first. The best practice here would be something like this: `[1, [message, fields, here]]` instead of `[1, message, fields, here]`. Fixing this would be a protocol breaking change.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIdeally a messagepack protocol that follows best practices in the messagepack community.\n",

        "body":  "In writing my own `IHubProtocol` implementation, I found that when a method is invoked, there is no good way to determine whether a method exists with the `target` name to invoke. As a result, I get unhelpful exceptions thrown.\n\nIn particular, while deserializing the invocation request I need the parameter types. I call `IInvocationBinder.GetParameterTypes` passing in the name of the target method that I have already deserialized. When the method does not exist, it simply returns an empty array, causing my `BindArguments` method to throw because the number of arguments and the number of parameters mismatch. But that\u0027s a red herring. The real issue is that the method itself does not exist at all.\n\nI notice that `IInvocationBinder.GetReturnType` _does_ throw when the target method does not exist. \n\nWhy the two diverging and undocumented policies for these two methods?\n\nWhat is the best way to handle this?\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/406950442014149931322f97c42e999ce03fdb71/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Client.Core/src/HubConnection.cs#L2395-L2423",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n### Describe the bug\nThe SignalR Java client version 9.0.4 has a memory leak when using the `stream()` method for real-time data streaming. The issue is caused by the use of unbounded `ReplaySubject.create()` in two places:\n\n1. `InvocationRequest.java:14` - `private final Subject\u003cObject\u003e pendingCall = ReplaySubject.create();`\n2. `HubConnection.java:796` - `ReplaySubject\u003cT\u003e subject = ReplaySubject.create();` (in the `stream()` method)\n\nThese unbounded replay subjects cache ALL emitted items indefinitely, causing memory to grow without bounds during long-running WebSocket connections with continuous data streams.\n\n### To Reproduce\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create a SignalR Java client connection\n2. Use the `stream()` method to subscribe to a high-frequency data stream (e.g., real-time trading data)\n3. Keep the connection running for extended periods (\u003e1 hour)\n4. Monitor memory usage - it will continuously grow until OutOfMemoryError occurs\n\nExample code:\n```java\nHubConnection hubConnection = HubConnectionBuilder.create(\"wss://example.com/hub\")\n    .withAccessTokenProvider(Single.just(accessToken))\n    .build();\n\nhubConnection.start().blockingAwait();\n\n// This will cause memory leak over time\nObservable\u003cMarketData\u003e stream = hubConnection.stream(MarketData.class, \"StreamMarketData\", \"symbol\");\nstream.subscribe(data -\u003e {\n    // Process real-time data\n});\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\nThe streaming connection should maintain stable memory usage over time, not accumulating all historical data in memory.\n\n### Actual behavior\nMemory usage grows continuously as `ReplaySubject` caches all emitted items. This leads to OutOfMemoryError after extended periods of streaming.\n\n### Workaround\nCurrently, we\u0027re forced to periodically disconnect and reconnect the SignalR connection every 5-15 minutes to clear the internal buffers and prevent OOM errors.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nReplace unbounded `ReplaySubject.create()` with either:\n1. Bounded replay: `ReplaySubject.createWithSize(bufferSize)` \n2. PublishSubject for no caching: `PublishSubject.create()`\n3. Make buffer size configurable\n\n### Environment\n- SignalR Java Client version: 9.0.4\n- Java version: 11/17\n- Platform: Android\n- RxJava version: 3.x\n\n### Stack trace\n```\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Failed to allocate a 24 byte allocation with 1349584 free bytes and 1317KB until OOM\n    at com.android.org.conscrypt.ConscryptEngine.newResult(ConscryptEngine.java:1363)\n    at com.android.org.conscrypt.ConscryptEngine.unwrap(ConscryptEngine.java:933)\n    ...\n    at okhttp3.internal.ws.WebSocketReader.processNextFrame(WebSocketReader.kt:0)\n    at okhttp3.internal.ws.RealWebSocket.loopReader(RealWebSocket.kt:293)\n```\n\n### Additional context\nThis issue affects production applications using SignalR for real-time data streaming, particularly in financial trading applications where data streams are continuous and high-frequency.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Yes, I\u0027d be happy to contribute a fix for this issue.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAfter analyzing the code, I believe the simplest and most effective fix is to replace the unbounded `ReplaySubject.create()` calls with bounded versions using `ReplaySubject.createWithSize(1)`. \n\nThis will:\n\n1. Limit the buffer to only the most recent value\n2. Prevent unlimited memory growth during long-running streams\n3. Maintain backward compatibility\n4. Keep the same behavior for most use cases\n\n## Changes Required\n\nThe fix requires minimal changes in two files:\n\n1. **HubConnection.java:796**\n   ```java\n   // Before\n   ReplaySubject\u003cT\u003e subject = ReplaySubject.create();\n   \n   // After  \n   ReplaySubject\u003cT\u003e subject = ReplaySubject.createWithSize(1);\n   ```\n\n2. **InvocationRequest.java:14**\n   ```java\n   // Before\n   private final Subject\u003cObject\u003e pendingCall = ReplaySubject.create();\n   \n   // After\n   private final Subject\u003cObject\u003e pendingCall = ReplaySubject.createWithSize(1);\n   ```\n\n## Alternative Solutions Considered\n\n1. **PublishSubject** - Would not cache any values, might break existing code expecting at least one cached value\n2. **BehaviorSubject** - Similar to ReplaySubject(1) but requires an initial value\n3. **replay(1) operator** - More complex implementation, same result\n\n## Testing\n\nI can add tests to verify:\n- Memory usage remains stable during long-running streams\n- Existing functionality is preserved\n- Late subscribers still receive the most recent value\n\n## Next Steps\n\nBefore I proceed with the PR, I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do you agree with the `ReplaySubject.createWithSize(1)` approach, or would you prefer a different solution?\n2. Are there any specific test scenarios you\u0027d like me to include?\n3. Should I add a configuration option to customize the buffer size, or is a fixed size of 1 acceptable?\n\nI\u0027m familiar with the contribution guidelines and will ensure the PR follows all requirements including signing the CLA.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback!",

This modification has resulted in a breaking change for telemetry correlation in Application Insights.\nImpact on Application Insights telemetry:\n\n- The operation_Id field in Application Insights is now null instead of containing the expected correlation ID\n- The operation_ParentId field in Application Insights is now null instead of containing the parent activity ID\n- This breaks telemetry correlation chains, making it difficult to trace requests across distributed systems\n\nRoot cause: The .NET SDK for Application Insights relies on Activity.Current to establish telemetry correlation. When Activity.Current is set to null before hub method execution, the Application Insights SDK cannot capture the proper correlation context, resulting in missing operation_Id and operation_ParentId values.\n\nI have also tested .NET 10 preview 6 and the bug is still there.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n- operation_Id should contain the trace ID from the current activity\n- operation_ParentId should contain the span ID from the parent activity\n- Telemetry correlation should be maintained throughout the SignalR hub method execution\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n- Clone [this repo ](https://github.com/Hamata6/DemoForAppInsightsNet9Server). It is a newly created Blazor Web app on .NET 9 with only sample code on the Home page.\n- Add Application Insights in Visual Studio via Project \u003e Add Application Insights Telemetry \u003e Azure Application Insights.\n- Run solution and click button on homepage to trigger a TrackException.\n- Check your Application Insights exception logs to see that there is no operation_Id and operation_ParentId:\n`exceptions\n| where outerMessage == \"Demo Exception for Activity.Current issue\"\n| project timestamp, outerMessage, operation_Id, operation_ParentId`\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\nSince 9.0.0 through 10.0.0 preview 6\n\n### Anything else?\n\nOutput on .NET 9:\n\u003cimg width=\"853\" height=\"76\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac806f28-5b08-42b7-a3e4-a3c761af0a5a\" /\u003e\n\nOutput on .NET 8:\n\u003cimg width=\"820\" height=\"72\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675ddf0e-5d31-4e67-9e3e-32629584ae91\" /\u003e",

As a result, SignalR considers the client unresponsive and closes the connection.\n\n\nEnvironment:\n\n- ASP.NET Core (SignalR)\n- SignalR JavaScript client (browser)\n- Browser: Chrome/Edge (latest)\n\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\n- The SignalR connection should remain stable during/after the print dialog is open.\n- Heartbeats should ideally tolerate temporary UI thread blocking.\n\nActual Behavior:\n\n- While the print dialog is open, no pings are sent.\n- After the ClientTimeoutInterval elapses, the connection closes with error:\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Start a simple SignalR hub with default options:\n  services.AddSignalR(options =\u003e\n  {\n      options.EnableDetailedErrors = true;\n      options.HandshakeTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60);\n      options.KeepAliveInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15);\n      options.ClientTimeoutInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(50);\n  });\n\n\n2. Connect a JavaScript client in the browser.\n\n3. While connected, trigger a window.print() call.\n  setTimeout(() =\u003e {\n      window.print();\n  }, 0);\n\n4.Observe network traffic and logs.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nConnection closed with an error.\nOperationCanceledException: Client hasn\u0027t sent a message/ping within the configured ClientTimeoutInterval.\n\nLog\n\"type\":7,\"error\":\"Connection closed with an error. OperationCanceledException: Client hasn\u0027t sent a message/ping within the configured ClientTimeoutInterval.\",\"allowReconnect\":true\n\n\n\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8\n\n### Anything else?\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1333\" height=\"182\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7afd019f-4df0-4aa6-844d-9b120b4dbd8b\" /\u003e",

Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\n--\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nAllow configuration of `WebSocketFactory` on browser platforms in SignalR to enable advanced customization and reduce boilerplate for scenarios where query string-based authentication is required.\n\nUnsure why this OS specific check is required: \n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/62c472820c02eb607510107b8c196d8d35aae615/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Http.Connections.Client/src/HttpConnectionFactory.cs#L95\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\nWhen using SignalR in browser environments, the `WebSocketFactory` property from `HttpConnectionOptions` is silently ignored during `HubConnection` setup in `HubConnectionFactory`. Currently this configuration object is shallow copied and some properties are dropped depending on OS, this means the default WebSocketFactory method in (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/62c472820c02eb607510107b8c196d8d35aae615/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Http.Connections.Client/src/Internal/WebSocketsTransport.cs#L305) is always used when on browser.  \n\nThis behavior is not clearly documented and prevents developers from customizing WebSocket behavior--such as injecting query string parameters for authentication (not just \"access_token\") --without resorting to verbose boilerplate code. The lack of configurability limits flexibility for advanced scenarios, even when the desired customization is compatible with browser WebSocket APIs.\n\n## In scope\n\n- **Flexible Authentication via Query String not restricted to providing `access_token`**\n\n- **Advanced WebSocket Customization in Browser using SignalR**\n\n- **Reducing Boilerplate -- currently need to adjust the Hub Url manually** \n\n- **Improved Developer Experience and Transparency using SignalR**\n\n## Out of scope\n\n**Cross-platform WebSocket Compatibility Guarantees** - We are not requesting SignalR to guarantee consistent behavior across all platforms—only that developers be allowed to opt into customization where feasible.\n\n## Risks / unknowns\n\n**Security Misuse**\nExposing low-level configuration could lead to misuse (e.g., passing sensitive data via query strings) if not clearly guided\n\n**Browser API Limitations**\n\nNative browser WebSocket APIs may restrict certain customizations, which could limit the effectiveness of exposing `WebSocketFactory` in some environments.\n\n## Examples\n\n- Use service provider to customize the default `ClientWebSocket` behaviour\n- Use an extended version of the ClientWebSocket class\n\n\u003c!--\n# Detailed design\n\nChange the behavior of the HubConnectionFactory to not do this shallow clone that\u0027s OS specific: \n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/62c472820c02eb607510107b8c196d8d35aae615/src/SignalR/clients/csharp/Http.Connections.Client/src/HttpConnectionFactory.cs#L95\n\nAt least for the `WebSocketFactory` property.\n\nIf there\u0027s one clear design you have consensus on, you could do that directly in a PR.\n--\u003e\n",
