HTML5 also isn\u0027t supported on older browsers (IE9 was the example I found).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it\u0027s not worth the work that would be required to remove our dependencies here in the absence of a more unified vision about what value we can produce from re-working DataAnnotations.",

The initial thought was that we could do something tactical building upon either browser features such as constraint validation or hand rolling a facsimile of jQuery.validation. But on further inspection, we realize that an alternative that simply removes jquery does not move the needle enough for us invest in. \r\n\r\n~~https://github.com/aspnet/specs/blob/main/notes/RemoveJQueryUnobtrusiveValidation.md~~ has some notes about our conversations around this and what we might expect if we were to consider improving this experience:\r\n\r\n## Offline notes \r\n\r\nI think we need to start by defining the goals here, for me those are:\r\n*\tDevelopers should be able to author great forms out of the box without writing JS code.\r\n*\tAuthoring more advanced forms should be an incremental process, meaning you can add/compose on top of the existing form functionality instead of rewriting the form in its entirety.\r\n*\tThere should be room for a progressive enhancement story, where you can author a form that can work in the context of a SPA as well as in the context of a plain server rendered app without separate solutions.\r\nIn general, I think we would need to look at several things:\r\n*\tInvestigate the cost of removing jquery and jquery validate (WITHOUT) accounting for extensibility based on the current set of supported validation rules. Tell people\r\n*\tMy gut is that the \"most complicated\" to keep compat with are CreditCard, EmailAddress, Phone, and Url; and I\u0027m not sure they matter that much, for example, Url and EmailAddress perform incredibly dumb validations in .net core (see here) so they are useless. Credit card and phone can easily be converted to equivalent JS validations.\r\n*\tFor things like numbers, etc. There\u0027s good support now for the Intl global that does most of the job for localized comparisons.\r\n    *\tInvestigate/define what experience we want to enable here around forms:\r\n*\tLook at great form experiences on the web and identify what makes them great:\r\n    *\tPlaceholders.\r\n    *\tAutofill (Phone number, credit card info, etc).\r\n    *\tValidation on input/focus out.\r\n    *\tInput states.\r\n    *\tDynamism (new form sections rendering in response to changes, multi-step forms/wizards, etc.)\r\n    *\tForm reset.\r\n*\tIdentify the end-to-end scenarios for forms that we care about:\r\n    *\tVanilla MVC/Razor pages app.\r\n    *\tMVC app + JS Islands.\r\n    *\tMVC + SPA framework.\r\n    *\tMVC + Blazor\r\n    *\tBlazor.\r\n*\tIdentify the progressions/cut-offs for each transition:\r\n    *\tWhat should you be able to do out of the box without writing any JS*\r\n    *\tWhat should you be able to do with vanilla JS (no framework involved)\r\n    *\tWhen would you need to switch to a full-blown SPA framework*\r\n    *\tWhen you need to switch to a new approach,\r\n    *\tHow big are the changes you need to make*\r\n    *\tAre there things from the implementation you can reuse*\r\n    *\tInvestigate what modern browser standards we can leverage to offer a better experience:\r\n*\tCan we use the built-in HTML5 validation mechanism to implement the validation rules*\r\n*\tCan we encapsulate the validation primitives in web components in a way that they can be reused across different parts of the stack and with other UI frameworks*\r\n*\tWhat other modern HTML5 features we can leverage to offer a more complete out of the box forms experience*\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We still haven\u0027t shipped 1.0, so breaking API feedback is welcome. Need a nonzero testing story, too. Sponsors? 😁 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/34777 was a great solution to https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/17412 (other than deleting `public` members that should be marked `[Obsolete]` instead). The documentation for the new properties should include a warning like:\r\n\r\n\u003e Changing this value is incompatible with jQuery Unobtrusive Validation 4.x and lower.\r\n\r\n...with a link to docs that can be updated to reflect the current state of the art. That may eventually be \"it Just Works™️ with jUV 5.x or `aspnet-client-validation`\" but in the meantime it can enumerate known limitations/options.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t think anyone is surprised that updating jUV isn\u0027t a top priority for the team, but waiting on a perfect solution has thus far meant there\u0027s no solution (except reflection). A well-documented optional configuration seems like a great first step that can be mostly community-driven.",

Please describe.\r\nConfiguring Filters for Razor Pages does not work on areas.\r\ni.e. the following will not work for areas:\r\n`options.Conventions.ConfigureFilter(model =\u003e new AdminDomainFilterFactory(model));`\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nI think it should be added to the documentation.\r\nthat this is not possible.\r\n\r\nCurrently a workaround would be adding that:\r\n```\r\npublic static IPageApplicationModelConvention ConfigureAreaFilter(\r\n            this PageConventionCollection conventions,\r\n            string areaName,\r\n            Func\u003cPageApplicationModel, IFilterMetadata\u003e factory)\r\n        {\r\n            if (areaName == null)\r\n                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(areaName));\r\n            if (conventions == null)\r\n                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof (conventions));\r\n            if (factory == null)\r\n                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof (factory));\r\n            return conventions.AddAreaFolderApplicationModelConvention(areaName, \"/\", (Action\u003cPageApplicationModel\u003e) (model =\u003e model.Filters.Add(factory(model))));\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\na better solution of course would be if it would work on **all** areas\r\n\r\nwhich is possible by implementing a `IPageApplicationModelConvention` that does not filter out the areaName.",

        "body":  "\u003e as in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/22021  said , I still think the  **modular abstraction** is a really good thing for people to use  and test the new `AssemblyLoaderContext` ,\r\nand force more area where people do `Assembly.Load()` or `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath()`\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nas my goal is  to load a  whole `asp.net core app` as  `subapp`  in asp.net core (it\u0027s in very earlier stage) ,  after I successfull to \"side host\" it,  there is error that cause the \"subapp\"  outof the `PluginAssemblyLoadContext`, after debugging, I found that it caused by a line of razor code: \r\n```razor\r\n@model YourModelClass\r\n\r\n```\r\nthere are total 2 issue:\r\n1.  the biggest problem :  this line of code some how use `AssemblyLoadContext.Deafult` to load the main assebmly\r\n2.  the `.deps.json` do not have any dependency of the `\u003cAssemblyName\u003e.view.dll`\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nthis is my repo https://github.com/John0King/LazyMan.ModularLoader ,  use `test-razor-error` branch if the code is not same as I write this issue\r\n\r\n1.  compile the folder  `~/test/SubAppTest` , this will copy the asset to  `~/test/SubAppTest/dist` folder\r\n2.  run the `~/test/SubAppTest/HostApp`  project \r\n3.  navigate to `http://localhost:61571/m/ModuleApp1`  to start the \"Module1App\",  u can only vist this url once\r\n4.  open \"http://localhost:8090/\"  to see the \"side loaded\" app\r\n\r\nI temporary fix this by add a line in `HostApp`\u0027s `Startup`\r\n```C#\r\n// razor bug fix\r\n            AssemblyLoadContext.Default.Resolving += (alc, asbn) =\u003e\r\n            {\r\n                return AssemblyLoadContext.All.OfType\u003cPluginAssemblyLoadContext\u003e()\r\n                .Where(x =\u003e x.PluginInfo.PluginName.Equals(asbn.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\r\n                .FirstOrDefault()?.LoadFromAssemblyName(asbn);\r\n            };\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### statck trace\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly

I hope this lookup behavior can be fixed in dotnet 8.\r\nwhich in turns become problematic because plugins assemblies are not standalone assemblies, sometimes a plugin in itself is a full project divided into multiple assemblies for clean code architecture or similar methodology used in it.",

The page is in the template, but the Razor pages aren\u0027t loaded unless you choose to enable the individual auth or do it manually. It was previously working because Razor pages was loaded through `AddMvc()`, but since 3.x, the template only use `AddControllersWithViews()`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not visible in Development environment, which use the `UseDeveloperExceptionPage()`, but only for `UseExceptionHandler(\"/Error\")`, because the route doesn\u0027t exists, then the default route fallback provided by `UseSpa` takes over and returns an HTTP 200 with the default page as content.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n`dotnet new react`\r\nedit `WeatherForecastController.cs` and throw an exception in the `Get()` method\r\n`dotnet run` then go the the \"Fetch data\" page\r\nyou should see the HTTP 500 request in your browser debugger for `https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast`\r\n`dotnet publish` to build the react project\r\nedit `launchSettings.json` and set `Production` as environment\r\n`dotnet run` then go the the \"Fetch data\" page\r\nyou should see the HTTP 200 request in your browser debugger for `https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast`\r\n\r\n### Proposals\r\n\r\nRemove the `#if (IndividualLocalAuth)` statements in `src/ProjectTemplates/Web.Spa.ProjectTemplates/content/Angular-CSharp/Startup.cs` around `services.AddRazorPages();` and `endpoints.MapRazorPages();`\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nRemove the error page and `app.UseExceptionHandler(\"/Error\");`.

        "body":  "### Suggestion\r\n\r\nHi, it would be great if the validation APIs could allow async model validation. This was previously suggested and closed in #7573, but it\u0027d be greatly appreciated if you could reconsider.\r\n\r\n### Background information \u0026 context\r\n\r\nI\u0027m the author of the [FluentValidaiton](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) library, and we provide integration with ASP.NET\u0027s model validation API by implementing a custom `ObjectModelValidator` and `ModelValidatorProvider`. This works well for the most part, and is used extensively by the .NET community, however one sticking point is handling async validation. \r\n\r\nFluentValidation\u0027s validators allow either sync or async execution, but because ASP.NET\u0027s validation APIs are only synchronous, we are unable to offer the library\u0027s full feature-set to ASP.NET users, and warn them that if their validator contains async code then it\u0027ll end up be run synchronously. If they need this to be async, they have to stop using auto validation and instead manually invoke the validator inside an async controller action. Neither of these are ideal. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, from an API design perspective we have to maintain 2 code paths inside FluentValidation for both the sync/async APIs which leads to a lot of duplication. This is mainly done for the sake of ASP.NET - if ASP.NET\u0027s validation pipeline was async, we could deprecate (and eventually drop) our synchronous implementation, but for as long as ASP.NET mandates synchronous validators we have to continue maintaining both implementations. \r\n\r\nI believe the following types/methods would need to become async in order to support this:\r\n\r\n- ObjectModelValidator.Validate overloads\r\n- ValidationVisitor.Validate and the various methods called by this that recurse through the object graph\r\n- IModelValidator.Validate and its implementors\r\n\r\n(#7573 specifically asked for the data annotation attributes themselves to add async validation methods too, but personally I think this is less important. If the infrastructure were in place with the above types, then the community can provide async implementations of `IModelValidator` as necessary, whether that\u0027s using FluentValidation, or custom attributes or something else)\r\n\r\nIf you could reconsider adding support for this, it would be a very welcome addition for the users of our library. I\u0027d be happy to help implement this, if that\u0027d be valuable. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any more info.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.\r\n\r\n//cc @pranavkm \r\n\r\n",

This means we still have to either write the code to block the thread which is not quite sure if it will cause a deadlock in some cases. Or, we might need to write some codes to run that in another thread or similar which in the end will hurt the performance. This is not the worst. The worst is that it wastes a lot of time to check what is the right design when one side said that I have only async pattern and the other side said \"No, I don\u0027t like it\" while there are so many articles out there said that it will have a deadlock if you turn it into synchronous pattern incorrectly.",

This is still a major issue and blocker for users of the FluentValidation library - it causes no end of problems for our end users and also prevents us from being able to move the library forward. \r\n\r\nI\u0027d really urge you to reconsider bringing this forward into a new release, especially now that we have `ValueTask` within the framework, it\u0027s straightforward to support both sync and async apis while still optimising for the common synchronous use case. Adding support for this would add a real tangible benefit for users - it is one of our most common feature requests, but my hands are tied.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I would be very happy to help implement this.

Honestly, something more semantic and more strongly typed could be a nice feature to have in the framework.  ",

It mainly takes the existing asp-net-core logic making it async-proof. Nothing more. You can give it a try [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NativeWaves.AsyncValidation/1.0.1). I see this as a prototype and don\u0027t know atm where we are going with it from here. It\u0027s used by us in production (for our purposes) and seems to run stable.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n",

        "body":  "**Motivation:**\r\n\r\nCSS for a popular CDN package [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) consists entirely of pseudo-element definitions, such as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.bi::before {\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  font-family: bootstrap-icons !important;\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the ASP.NET fallback tester offers no support for pseudo-elements, because the JavaScript for the tester calls a single-parameter overload of [`getComputedStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle). To test pseudo-elements, we need to pass the name of the the pseudo-element to be tested as a second parameter of `getComputedStyle`.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n\r\nWe add support for testing pseudo-elements by setting an `asp-fallback-test-pseudo-element` attribute:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    asp-fallback-test-class=\"bi\"\r\n    asp-fallback-test-pseudo-element=\"before\"\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nWe then pass the value of the `asp-fallback-test-pseudo-element` as the second parameter to the fallback tester function, which then forwards it to `getComputedStyle`; if no value is specified, we pass `null`.",

I have a few questions before I start:\r\n- Do you agree that implementing this feature is a reasonable project to start contributing to aspnet.core?\r\n- Would you happen to know which minifier/uglifier was used on the LinkTagHelper_FallbackJavaScript.js from the js folder to arrive at the minified version in the compiler/resources folder? JSCompress produces a nearly identical output, except for the names of the variables.\r\n\r\nCould either one of you please let me know?",

        "body":  "### Describe the bug\r\nSince .NET 6, the `HttpContext.RequestAborted` does not updates when the request is cancelled. This used to work with .NET 5.\r\nIsCancellationRequested stays in false even tho the request has been canceled and CanBeCancelled is set to true.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nI started a .NET 6 Angular project and created an HTTP GET request and subscribe to it, the Request is in an infinite loop intentionally so it can only be ended by the cancellation token. Also have a subject to cancel the request with an other button.\r\n\r\nIn .NET 5 this works flawlessly. In .NET 6 its unusable.\r\n\r\nAn Example Repo can be found here: https://github.com/blogcraft/TestCancel\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- ASP.NET Core version: .NET 6.0.100\r\n- The IDE (VS / VS Code/ VS4Mac) you\u0027re running on, and its version: VS Code\r\n- Include the output of `dotnet --info`:\r\n\r\n\u003cdetails\u003e\r\n  \u003csummary\u003eSDK de .NET (que refleje cualquier global.json):\r\n Version:   6.0.100\r\n Commit:    9e8b04bbff\r\n\r\nEntorno de tiempo de ejecución:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.22000\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 6.0.0\r\n  Commit:  4822e3c3aa\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.415 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.401 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\u003c/summary\u003e\r\n\u003c/details\u003e\r\n",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\r\nThis is a bit of a shot in the dark, since I found out that `UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer` is not the _recommended/default_ way anymore, but rather SPAs to be in front of the ASP.NET (in the way of the new SPA templates). And that this API might become obsolete and removed. \r\n\r\nI\u0027ve never had any issues with it, so thank you for what you\u0027ve been doing in the past!\r\n\r\nI need to proxy to different URIs (known at runtime), depending on the request, to be more specific: depending on some items in `HttpClient.Items` set by other middlewares. The `baseUriTaskFactory` parameter description says the following:\r\n`A callback that will be `**`invoked on each request`**` to supply a  Task that resolves with the target base URI to which requests should be proxied.`\r\nI want to actually access some information about **`each request`** in order to resolve the URI and currently the `baseUriTaskFactory` is a paremeterless function.\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\nWe welcome API proposals! We have a process to evaluate the value and shape of new API. There is an overview of our process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/APIReviewProcess.md). This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\r\nFirst, please describe the purpose and value of the new API here.\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;\r\n\r\npublic static class SpaProxyingExtensions\r\n{\r\n+    public static void UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer(this ISpaBuilder spaBuilder, Func\u003cHttpContext, Task\u003cUri\u003e\u003e baseUriTaskFactory)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide code examples that highlight how the proposed API additions are meant to be consumed.\r\nThis will help suggest whether the API has the right shape to be functional, performant and useable.\r\nYou can use code blocks like this:\r\n```csharp\r\nspa.UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer((httpContext) =\u003e {\r\n    var somePort = httpContext.Items[\"somePort\"];\r\n    return Task.FromResult(new Uri($\"http://localhost:{somePort}/\"));\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!",

The built app never \"sees\" the css. \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhether a file is physically situated as a real file in the `css` folder or as a link, is something that has been taken for granted in Visual Studio for many years. But with a test css file it does not work, at runtime the styles are not seen.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a blazor project, move the generated `site.css` file to some arbitrary folder outside of the project. In VS right click the `css` folder in the Solution Explorer and add the file as  link:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12262952/192326528-469773eb-22f1-4f5a-b282-9e599755a778.png)\r\n\r\ngiving:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12262952/192327259-5c12ff1e-6168-4a8c-8d0d-b9bffc36de74.png)\r\n\r\nAs you\u0027ll see the styles are never used, unseen by the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nCuriosly, if we _publish_ the project then the linked `css` file is copied to the published `wwwroot/css` folder. Also if we mark the  linked file in Visual Studio as \"Copy Alway\" the file (and wwwroot folder) are copied to the bin/debug/net6.0 folder too.\r\n\r\nBut when we debug the app \"sees\" the wwwroot folder in the project folder itself and so never sees the linked css file.\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_",

The script only checks whether the files exist, not if they actually contain the valid/current dev-cert. This resulted in an \"untrusted connection\" message in the Browser and it was rather annoying to figure out what went wrong.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe SPA template infrastructure should pick up that the dev-certs rotated and rerun the export\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n- Rotate the dev-certs\r\n- Notice that the exported *.pem and *.key files are not updated\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n7.0.102\n\n### Anything else?\n\nTo fix this, I manually removed the pem and the key files from the `…appdata/Roaming/ASP.NET/https/` folder, which were then regenerated with the new certificate on the next startup.",

        "body":  "The idea is that you can have a package.json file that only contains dependencies, and that can be consumed directly inside ASP.NET Core via static web assets.\n\nCurrently we support integrating with NPM, but we assume that you are going to have a build step (which typically bundles/copies files to an output folder) and we are going to expose these over the wwwroot folder.\n\nHowever, if you just want to consume the files in the package directly (as you would do within the bundle) it becomes hard to do, as typically you need an extra step to copy the files and define them as assets.\n\nInstead of that, we can build a \"node resolver\" (similar to the one every bundler has) that can automatically expose the contents of a package as if they were part of the wwwroot. The way this works is as follows:\n* We detect package.json files in your app.\n* We parse the json file and read the \"dependencies\" node.\n* For each dependency:\n  * We start by looking for a \"node_modules\" folder side by side with the package.json.\n  * If we find it:\n    * We search for the package name inside.\n    * If we find a folder with the package name:\n      * We read the package.json for the package.\n      * We search for the \"main\" property in the package.\n      * If present, we map the path \"package-name\" to the full path of the file pointed by main.\n      * If not present, we map the path \"package-name\" to the full path of the file `index.js` if it exists.\n      * Additionally, if present, we map the contents of the \"dist\" folder of the package to \"package-name/\u003c\u003cpath-inside-dist\u003e\u003e\"\n        * We do not want to map the entire contents of the package because we do not have a way to trim them.\n        * We might alternatively, map the entire package, but use a pattern to filter that only covers \"dist\" by default.\n        * The strings we use to consume specific files from a package should match exactly those used when using an \"import\" in js.\n    * If we do not find a folder with the package name, we break\n  * If we do not find a node_modules folder, we try to find one in a directory above.\n\nIn addition to that, many packages ship source maps and minified versions of the files.\n\n* We can have conventions that make sure that we pick the right file depending on whether we are publishing the app or developing.\n* For example, if you add \"jquery\", the \"jquery\" package contains \"jquery.js\" and \"jquery.min.js\".\n* Static web assets can automatically serve \"jquery.js\" (unminified) during development and copy \"jquery.min.js\" into wwwroot/jquery.js at publish time.\n* In a similar way, it can automatically serve the source maps during development and avoid publishing those to the final output.\n* This ensures that during development you get the best experience and during publish you get the minified asset.\n\nA user can consume the file from a razor file by using `\u003cscript src=\"jquery\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e` or `\u003cscript src=\"jquery/dist/jquery.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e` in a very similar way as if they were using \"unpkg\" (https://unpkg.com/jquery@3.6.3/dist/jquery.js)\n\nThis would potentially all work without configuration (you drop a package.json into your project and we do the rest), or we could additionally provide some config options that can be specified inside `package.json` or the csproj file (although it feels more natural to put it inside package.json). Some of this options could be:\n* Common prefix to map the packages to, for example \"vendors\", \"lib\", etc.\n* Configuration for what paths to include on a per package basis (everything else gets filtered out).\n\nTo give a full example. Let\u0027s say we have an MVC app and we want to consume the common JS libraries that MVC/Razor pages use. We drop a `package.json` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"bootstrap\": \"^5.2.3\",\n    \"jquery\": \"^3.6.3\",\n    \"jquery-validation\": \"^1.19.5\",\n    \"jquery-validation-unobtrusive\": \"^4.0.0\"\n  },\n}\n```\n\nAnd we consume it from \"_Layout.cshtml\" as follows:\n```html\n\u003c!-- Mapping jquery from \"main\" inside package.json --\u003e\n\u003cscript src=\"jquery\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c!-- Mapping explicitly selecting the file to consume from the package --\u003e\n\u003cscript src=\"bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\n",

GA4 tells you to insert its analytics script using a `script async` tag:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003cscript async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-12345\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\u003cscript\u003e\r\n\twindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\r\n\tfunction gtag() { dataLayer.push(arguments); }\r\n\tgtag(\u0027js\u0027, new Date());\r\n\tgtag(\u0027config\u0027, \u0027G-12345\u0027);\r\n\u003c/script\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nI\u0027m not entirely sure how to do that using pure JS, or what the consequences would be for the async nature of the script loading if it were done that way instead of just pasting the markup.  Nor is it a way of adding the Analytics that\u0027s supported by Google as far as I can tell.  Obviously, just rendering that markup or not rendering it is a reliable way to turn it on or off, however.",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nEnabling AddRazorRuntimeCompilation will cause Visual Studio to unnecessarily search for PDBs on symbol servers. The assemblies generated by the RuntimeCompilation ViewCompiler will always generate a Portable PDB stream which will be included in the call to Assembly.Load().\r\n\r\nDue to VS Debugger\u0027s interaction with the CLR, the debugger will first try to search for a PDB that matches the compiled view assembly (but none exists on disk or servers). Only later will the CLR inform the debugger of PDB stream that was included. At this point, the customer has already wasted time waiting for the debugger to query symbol servers.\r\n\r\nThe ViewCompiler has a [defunct comment](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/95ed45c6710e4e4fa878c4d76e8f5a83eeaf1c3b/src/Mvc/Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation/src/CSharpCompiler.cs#L144) explaining that the Roslyn API\u0027s do not allow for embedded PDB\u0027s, which is no longer accurate (I have prototyped embedded locally).\r\n\r\nThe RuntimeCompilation view compiler should always default to compiling with Embedded PDB\u0027s and not supply a PDB stream to the Assembly.Load call. This prevents the debugger from doing unnecessary symbol searches.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it may also be useful to emit an assembly level attribute in each RuntimeCompilation assembly that marks it as such, as I could not find any way to distinguish a runtime compiled assembly to avoid doing the symbol search.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC app\r\n2. Enable [Razor Runtime Compilation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-compilation?view=aspnetcore-7.0\u0026tabs=visual-studio#enable-runtime-compilation-for-all-environments)\r\n3. In Visual Studio:\r\n    - Enable Tools \u003e Options \u003e Debugging \u003e General \u003e Just My Code \r\n    - In Tools \u003e Options \u003e Debugging \u003e Symbols\r\n        - Enable Microsoft and NuGet Symbol Servers\r\n        - Enable \"Load all modules, unless excluded\"\r\n4. Start Debugging\r\n\r\nYou should notice that the progress dialog pops up that says Searching for Symbols on Microsoft and NuGet Symbol Servers for the razor runtime compilation assemblies. \n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

I don\u0027t actually believe there *is* a lack of interest here; I suspect a lot of people just literally aren\u0027t *aware* that they aren\u0027t getting the analyzers when explicitly referencing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` framework. It took me months to realize that the analyzers were not active in my library project.\r\n\r\nThe official guidance is to use `Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\"` or `Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Razor\"`, combined with a `\u003cFrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" /\u003e` item, in order to author libraries for ASP.NET Core. Yet if users do so, they get none of the analyzers that come with `Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"`.\r\n\r\nSome docs issues were opened requesting that this behavior at least be documented (https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/15327, https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/22879), so clearly people *are* hitting this in the real world. It was finally documented as basically \"tough luck\" if you\u0027re in that exact situation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/advanced/analyzers?view=aspnetcore-7.0#analyzers-require-microsoftnetsdkweb\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there was some discussion about improving the situation here: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3706\r\n\r\nThat issue was closed, too, and as far as I can tell, that\u0027s where the story unceremoniously ends. But the underlying issue was never resolved, despite the fact that it\u0027s a situation where the official guidance on making ASP.NET Core libraries leads to a meaningfully worse developer experience.\r\n\r\nSo I\u0027m opening this issue in an attempt to get some eyes on this problem again, because it seems like the ball was dropped on this one.\r\n\r\nJudging by https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/3706, it *seems* like there\u0027s a clear path forward: The web analyzers should be shipped in a similar fashion to how the BCL source generators (STJ, Regex, etc) are shipped today.",

UTF8 literals are stored directly in the PE image at specified RVA. The metadata heap size limitations thus do not apply.\r\n\r\nBesides, it would likely be faster and more memory efficient to render the pages since UTF16 to UTF8 encoding might be avoided.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Alternatively the MVC view engines rendering pipeline would likely need to be updated to either support interleaving string and UTF8 bytes values, or overhauled to be based on bytes instead of TextWriter.",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nDevelopers who already have significant JavaScript-based SPA applications (built through encouragement by Microsoft) have been abandoned by the ASP.NET team. Blazor is the new hotness (for good reasons) however, those of us unable or unwilling to stop all revenue-driving development in favour of a large migration to Blazor that delivers no customer nor business value are left out in the cold.\r\n\r\nMost frustratingly, Microsoft has been evasive and not taken clear opportunities to share the intention to drop JS-based SPA developers sooner, leaving us without an LTS version of the framework to use. \r\n\r\nI wrote at length about the unnecessary change from SpaServices to SpaProxy in .NET 6 here: https://richstokoe.com/2022/02/07/deconstructing-the-new-inner-loop-for-single-page-applications-spas-in-net-6/ this was even before the ASP.NET team started discussing the need for documenting this: https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/26373 with others also asking for the same thing 3 months before the documentation was written (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42732)\r\n\r\nFor those of us building modular monoliths, with both front end and back end in the same project, we are being forced to split these into separate applications, incurring new transient failure modes we explicitly set out to avoid. (Note: Even Blazor templates encourage mixing front end and back end code in a single service!)\r\n\r\nI highlighted that changes since .NET 6 have forced developers to re-architect their applications to suit this new development-time behaviour. Most worryingly, I highlighted that this change meant that **_by design_** code now ran differently in production compared to in development - I was bitten by this in production whereby in development I was routed to a JavaScript SPA for a particular URL and in production I was routed to an MVC view. This is not OK. This is very dangerous and there are real livelihoods at stake. The cost to test has increased and the confidence to release has plummeted.\r\n\r\nThe migration steps (documented 45 days before EOL of .NET 5) are non-trivial: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44600\r\n\r\nThis change has also caused myriad other changes to be made and it feels like the .NET team are either accidentally (law of unintended consequences and second order effects) or deliberately (to drive customers to Blazor) ruining the JS-based SPA development experience. For example, having to introduce ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES, to inject code into the process just to get SpaProxy to work. Having to clean up the complete mess that was log4shell a couple of years ago I\u0027m shocked that anyone is making external code injection easier these days...\r\n\r\nThis rearchitecture has broken a lot of customers with very common use cases. Myself and a few other users have hit roadblocks trying to speak to the team with some discussions just going cold and being automatically closed. \r\n\r\n- Documentation for .NET 6 (LTS) was still showing the SpaServices approach with only a few months before EOL. Very very clear and concrete concerns being met with obfuscation and deflection - https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/44187\r\n- Can\u0027t inject code in the default SpaProxy index page (questions ignored and issue auto-closed): https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/46780 \r\n- Can\u0027t work out how to prevent the 2nd site from restarting on subsequent restarts (e.g. hot reloads) - not documented https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43795\r\n- Linux docker container debugging - recommendation to fix is to completely rearchitect the application to suit! This is not acceptable - https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/41093\r\n- Updating packages breaks SpaProxy requiring updates to project template code - https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/40875\r\n\r\nmkArtakMSFT has finally conceded that SpaProxy is not part of the longer term framework roadmap (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49605) and that anything not Blazor is now a Community problem.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with .NET 8, the SPA templates have been dropped from the default install and we need to use community templates. (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/49388) This is pretty sickening. \r\n\r\nFor those of us who have been early adopters, drove adoption in our teams and organisations, built large applications on your recommendations, put up with documentation not being updated til the last second, and tried to keep up to date, the experience since .NET 6 is that we don\u0027t matter anymore and only those starting new projects where Blazor can be used from scratch are the customers you care about and wish to support. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\n\r\nMy request is simple. Please re-engage with us existing customers who have ploughed millions of dollars into Visual Studio, Azure and .NET to build and host apps the way you told us to.\r\n\r\nWe aren\u0027t all in a position to start projects from scratch with Blazor and train people up on it. Continuing support for previously-recommended ways of working should be table stakes, even across versions of the frameworks.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, give us more than 45 days notice that we need to completely rearchitect our applications to remain on LTS versions of the framework (especially when the communitu has been asking for documentation for months prior).\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI hope there is enough detail and examples of customers having similar issues, clearly showing the problems the community are now having raising concerns with the .NET teams and the self-inflicted additional work the teams have incurred, to prompt a review of the .NET team\u0027s relationship with the JS-based client side development community.\r\n\r\nTrust does not come easily and the dismissive attitude by .NET team members has burned a lot of trust. React and Angular are still the preferred client side development framework for many and while Microsoft may want to dominate this space with Blazor, this shows that lessons of the past have not been learned. You have to work with us, not try to force our hands. We\u0027re willing to work with you (hence going to the repeated effort to engage with you) but you need to show willing to work with us too. We rant because we still care, once we go silent, that\u0027s when it\u0027s too late as we\u0027ve gone elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAspire is the next new shiny thing, so I doubt this will even get noticed, but that would be doing us customers spending a fortune with you a serious disservice.\r\n\r\nCC: @coolcsh ",

Thank you for taking the time to verbalize what I have been thinking.\r\n\r\nI found this issue after spending days and a good amount of my employer\u0027s money trying to convert a .Net Core 6.0 SPA with Angular 15 to a .Net Core 8.0 (LTS) SPA with Angular 18. It already took several days to get the code to compile, serve locally, debug and test successfully. Since yesterday I\u0027m stuck with the next issue: Our Azure web app is not longer serving up index.html, even after modifying the ...server.csproj with removing the extra \"wwwroot/browser\" paths and having the client-side files right under the wwwroot, where the web.config sits. What an expensive frustration! It\u0027s not that I\u0027m trying this for the first time. We\u0027ve been using the .NET Core / Angular templates since .NET Core 3.1. \r\nAgain, thank you @richstokoe !\r\n\r\nAlso, thank you to @javiercn who has updated https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/26373.

Auto-generated code requires an explicit \u0027#nullable\u0027 directive in source.\r\n\r\n([click for full stack trace](https://gist.github.com/sandermvanvliet-stack/16b33d98dc07c59233ce4454bbc71f0f))\r\n\r\nWhen _disabling_ Razor runtime compilation and navigating to the route that uses this view it will be rendered normally.\r\n\r\n## Suspicions\r\n\r\nFor (I think..) both runtime and build compilation, the view is passed through the Razor source generator exactly in the same way so should amount to the same code. By catching the exception (see above) I\u0027ve managed to pull out the runtime generated code and using the `EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles` MSBuild property in the project I\u0027ve also managed to capture the build time generated code.\r\n\r\nComparing the two I can see some slight differences (namespace name and file paths) but otherwise they\u0027re similar.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that:\r\n\r\n- For _build time_ Razor compilation the code is first generated (using the Razor source generator) and then compiled _inside_ the actual project.\r\n- For _runtime_ Razor compilation, the code is generated but compiled in-memory in an isolated project\r\n\r\nAs it\u0027s not part of the actual project, the setting for `Nullable` isn\u0027t taken from that project which leads to this result that the compilation _thinks_ that `Nullable` is not enabled (where it _is_ enabled in the actual project).\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Version 17.8.3\r\n\r\n`dotnet --info`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   6.0.413\r\n Commit:    10710f7d8e\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.22631\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.413\\\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      8.0.0\r\n  Architecture: x64\r\n  Commit:       5535e31a71\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.405 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.408 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.413 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  7.0.115 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  8.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.32 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.26 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.32 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation` Version 6.0.5 \r\n",

Then, call an On Post Handler method that removes any element from that list, other than the last.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn the original ASP.Net Core/Angular templates, proxying was done in the back-end, while in the newer templates, the proxying moved to the client side.\r\nThis new approach breaks the back-end Authentication middleware, since redirect requests for the authentication layer don\u0027t get redirected to the ASP.Net Core backend, but to the Angular client server, which results in CORS errors due to the client proxy not introducing CORS headers, like was possible with the previous template.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere should be a straight-forward, documented means to use Authentication middleware in ASP.Net Core with the new client-side proxy mechanism.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nCreate a new project using the ASP.Net Core Angular template.\r\nUpdate the Program.cs to include:\r\n```\r\n            builder.Services\r\n            .AddAuthentication(sharedOptions =\u003e\r\n            {\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n                sharedOptions.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;\r\n            })\r\n            .AddCookie(options =\u003e\r\n            {\r\n

Something simple like:\r\n```\r\n  build.Services\r\n  .AddAuthentication(...)\r\n  ...\r\n  .AddOpenIdConnect( options =\u003e \r\n  {\r\n     if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) {\r\n       options.UseSpaPort = 4200; // replace ASP.Net Port with SpaProxy Port\r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the only other approach for this would be to add an OIDC client to the Angular app and trigger an authentication call from that, during development, before calling any back-end API.\r\nPresumably the front-end proxy would forward the redirects (when configured properly) and pass them to the back-end... \r\nBut adding all that code, just for being able to debug in Visual Studio, seems like an overly complicated approach...\r\n",

The cause is likely that there are duplicate assets in the pipeline which will very likely cause an issue at the time we generate the manifest.\n\nThe solution as you mentioned is to avoid having the duplicate reference in the project file. I\u0027m surprised that the project system doesn\u0027t de-dupe these, as we don\u0027t consume the raw `ProjectReference` and only the results after they have been processed.\n\nI think a fix here would likely involve improving the logic for `ProjectReference` to either error out or de-duplicate the references, we shouldn\u0027t be including logic to de-dupe them ourselves.\n\nI\u0027m going to move this issue to the backlog so that we can follow up with other folks on addressing this in the future.",

To reproduce, create a new ASPNET Core project from template, then change `WebApplication.CreateBuilder()` to `WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder()` in Program.cs.\n\nIt appears that calling `UseStaticWebAssets` allows this to work, but this isn\u0027t documented as far as I can tell.\n\n```\n// Program.cs\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);\nbuilder.WebHost.UseStaticWebAssets();\nvar app = builder.Build();\n...\napp.MapStaticAssets();\n```\n\nWould like to understand what is expected and what the correct setup should be. It seems that if `CreateSlimBuilder` alone isn\u0027t sufficient, there should be some kind of warning visible to developer. At the very least, this aspect should be documented.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEither `MapStaticAssets` truly works as a \"drop-in replacelement\" of `UseWebStaticFiles`, or incompatbilities are documented and/or warned to developer in tooling/build.\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.100\n",

Ultimately, this is the `IFileProvider` implementation that handles resolving static assets using the manifest-based strategy vs. resolving them by searching directly on disk.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you\u0027ll want to wire up the correct file providers manually:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.WebHost.UseStaticWebAssets();\n```\n\nThis issue affects both the `MapStaticAssets` and `UseStaticFiles` strategies in .NET 9 so workarounds will be needed for both.\n\nI\u0027ll put this in the backlog for now to evaluate urgency for a fix while the workaround is out.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWe used to have global helpers via the `App_Code` folder. They were INCREDIBLY useful for managing a complicated codebase with lots of common functionality.\n\nThat was removed, and we were given other idioms: view components, partials, tag helpers, local helpers, etc. Although those are useful, they are absolutely **not** the same. There are loads of common small snippets that one typically reuses in many views. One cannot implement a view component or partial for each. **That does not scale.** This is a real pain point for any non-trivial system.\n\nThis was requested many times over the years ([e.g. 1](https://github.com/aspnet/Razor/issues/715), [e.g. 2](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/5110)). There are many StackOverflow questions which show people struggling with this, including one with 75 upvotes and [33k views](https://stackoverflow.com/q/32331157/9971404).\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nEvery web framework has such functionality. ASP.NET did too. This would be a small addition which would provide immense and measurable benefit to your users, who\u0027ve asked for it in massive numbers over many years.\n\nPLEASE please consider giving us global helpers in v10.\n\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThank you for considering it!",

You have kindly explained to me how to configure the razor libs to create proper nuget packages. This setup works perfectly when I build the packages locally.

I have a vite build residing in the StaticAssets folder\n2. I use the following StaticAssets.target file:\n\n```xml\n\u003cProject\u003e\n  \u003cTarget Name=\"NpmInstall\"\n          Inputs=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)package.json\"\n          Outputs=\"$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)package-lock.json\"\n  \u003e\n    \u003cMessage Importance=\"high\" Text=\"Running npm install...\" /\u003e\n    \u003cExec Command=\"npm install\"\n          WorkingDirectory=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\"\n    /\u003e\n    \u003cCopy SourceFiles=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)package-lock.json\"\n          DestinationFolder=\"$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)\"\n    /\u003e\n  \u003c/Target\u003e\n\n  \u003cItemGroup\u003e\n    \u003cViteBuildInputs Include=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)**\"\n                     Exclude=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)node_modules\\**\"\n    /\u003e\n    \u003cUpToDateCheckInput Include=\"@(ViteBuildInputs)\"\n    /\u003e\n  \u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\n\n  \u003cTarget Name=\"ViteBuild\"\n          DependsOnTargets=\"NpmInstall\"\n          BeforeTargets=\"CoreBuild\"\n          Inputs=\"@(ViteBuildInputs)\"\n          Outputs=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\\wwwroot\\index.mjs\"\n  \u003e\n    \u003cMessage Importance=\"high\" Text=\"Running vite build...\" /\u003e\n    \u003cExec Command=\"npm run build:$(Configuration)\"\n          WorkingDirectory=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\"\n    /\u003e\n    \u003c!-- Validate output --\u003e\n    \u003cError Text=\"Vite build failed to generate wwwroot content\"\n           Condition=\"!Exists(\u0027$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)..\\wwwroot\u0027)\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/Target\u003e\n  \n\u003c/Project\u003e\n```\n\n3.

In the csproj, I have put\n```xml\n        \u003cContent Update=\"StaticAssets\\**\" Pack=\"false\" CopyToPublishDirectory=\"false\" /\u003e\n        \u003cNone Include=\"wwwroot\\**\\*\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"contentFiles/any/net9.0/wwwroot/\" /\u003e\n```\nThe first line was required to be able to publish to ACA, as it also complained I have duplicates. Then I did not get any static assets in the nuget, and hence I created the referenced ticket which told me to add the second line, which creates the static assets at least when building locally.\n\nI am really sorry I have such a mess, I am not used to javascript builds, especially in conjunction with this new blazor feature. In Blazor 8, this setup had worked. Please let me know what I should change. Again, thank you very much for your support.\n",

An example of this can be seen [in our CustomElements package](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Components/CustomElements/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.CustomElements.csproj), which includes dynamically-built JavaScript files as static web assets.\n\nHope this helps - let me know if there\u0027s anything else I can help clarify.",

If you find time to create a minimal repro project (without external tools like Vite) that shows the same problem, that will allow us to investigate the problem further, and if we conclude it\u0027s a problem with the app\u0027s build configuration, we may be able to provide a potential solution. Otherwise, I\u0027m afraid we may not be able to investigate this problem further. If this issue auto-closes at some point due to the lack of a repro, feel free to open a new one if you\u0027re able to construct a minimal repro. Thanks again.",

This uses still a FAT or an NTFS file system, which is case insensitive. As already @javiercn suspected, I suspect as well that it is a casing issue but one buried within the packing. When working with several IDEs in parallel, i got exceptions to have duplicate files, once packaged with C:\\\\somepath and once with c:\\\\somepath My guess is that when working with a file system which is essentially case insensitive, you don\u0027t notice this. Github Actions will use a true ext file system which is case sensitive and thus the packaging stops working. So in order to repro locally, you\u0027d probably have to have an ext file system. I haven\u0027t tried it, though, I have to admit, but have a strong feeling that this is the point.\n\nThanks for taking care!",

Hence, files change while the application runs.\n\nThese files are used in the application and are served with hash values. These hash values obviously must match the files that are served.\n\nTo achieve this, we use something like the following:\n\n```csharp\nstring GetHash(IWebHostEnvironment env, IMemoryCache cache, string path)\n{\n    if (cache.TryGetValue(path, out var hash))\n    {\n        var fileProvider = env.WebRootFileProvider;\n\n        var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions();\n\n        // this is apparently not working, since the cache entry never expires\n        cacheEntryOptions.AddExpirationToken(fileProvider.Watch(path));\n\n        hash = ...\n\n        cache.Set(path, hash, cacheEntryOptions);\n    }\n    return hash;\n}\n```\n\nSadly, that is not working, since the cache entry never expires.",

I have a paradigm where my view models have HtmlString/IHtmlContent fields that could be correctly displayed in .cshtml files just be directly referencing.\n\nHtmlString/IHtmlContent doesn\u0027t supported in Razor component, so I have to use MarkupString there. \nMarkupString is more lightweight marker concept, and doesn\u0027t require framework reference to whole ASP.NET server — I like it.\n\nHowever, .cshtml renderer doesn\u0027t support MarkupString, so I have to manually add Html.Raw here. I don\u0027t like it.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n1. MarkupString supported in .cshtml files and doesn\u0027t re-encoded.\n2. Ideally, MarkupString moved even higher in dependecies stack into some MS.Ext. assembly, totally untied from ASP.NET and will become universally recognized \"html marker\" class.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nIn ASP.NET Core 9, the new Assets API generates fingerprinted asset URLs that preserve the original casing of the project and file names (e.g., `_content/MyApp/MyApp.{fingerprint}.bundle.scp.css`). However, in production environments, it\u0027s common to enforce lowercase URLs for SEO, consistency, and caching efficiency. When using middleware that redirects all URLs to lowercase, these fingerprinted asset URLs get redirected unnecessarily, breaking caching and introducing unnecessary overhead.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI\u0027d love to see a way to configure the Assets API to emit lowercase URLs for fingerprinted assets, including both the `_content/{project}` segment and the file names. An options object or extension method would be ideal. Something like:\n\n`services.AddStaticAssets(options =\u003e options.UseLowercaseUrls = true);`\n\nIn the meantime, I\u0027ve worked around the issue by excluding `_content/` requests from URL rewriting using `app.UseWhen()`. This is effective but feels like a workaround. Built-in support would be preferable.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis request is similar in spirit to `RouteOptions.LowercaseUrls`, which enables consistent lowercase route generation. A unified lowercase URL strategy across both routes and static assets would be highly beneficial in production environments.\n\nReally appreciate the addition of the Assets API in .NET 9. It\u0027s a great step forward for managing static content and cache-busting in modern web apps. Just hoping for a little more flexibility here.\n\n**NOTE:**\nWhile it\u0027s true that [StaticWebAssetBasePath](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-9.0#static-web-asset-base-path) can be set to cause the entire base path to be lowercase, this does not force the file name itself to be lowercase as well (e.g., `_content/can_be_forced_lowercase/MyApp.{fingerprint}.bundle.scp.css`).",

Remove the default tag helper and add those two\n```\n@* _ViewImports.cshtml *@\n\n@namespace RazorTestTags.Pages\n@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers\n@removeTagHelper Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers.LinkTagHelper, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers\n@addTagHelper *, RazorTestTags\n```\n5.

Not generate invalid attributes on `select`, possible tricking up jquery-validation/jquery-validation-unobtrusive\n2. Perhaps `jquery-validation-unobtrusive` issue: Correctly handle `data-val-lenght*` properties on `select` element, it should validate value and not innerhtml.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSee above.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.300\n\n### Anything else?\n\njquery 3.7.1\njquery-validation-1.21.0\njquery-validation-unobtrusive-3.2.11",

        "body":  "In the older .Net Core SPA templates, the user was expected to manually run ng build -c=production or --prod which would generate the dist folder. The startup.cs file, by default, would only start the Angular Dev server using if env.IsDevelopment() was true which left IIS Express looking only for the dist folder and would serve it up.\n\nDuring a publish, the csproj file, by default, contained the PublishRunWebpack target which could be customized with conditional commands based on ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT or Configuration etc. These files would then be copied to the publish directory.\n\nThis was all fairly straight forward.\n\nThe new templates seem to lack, by default, support for running in prod mode locally, or even publishing in prod mode and documentation makes no explicit mention of doing so.\n\nIn my case, I\u0027m specifically interested to understand Microsoft\u0027s expected workflow for running the Angular SPA in production mode locally as we are building out and debugging a PWA, which requires prod mode, which will not run in angular dev server - only IIS Express. I also want to ensure my dev team doesn\u0027t have to jump through hoops and prefer to have them change the build configuration, or the aspnetcore_environment, to achieve this.\n\nThere also seems to be a significant change in how files are located. I\u0027ve seen the posts about the /browser folder, and the need to copy files manually to wwwroot when running in IIS Express lmode. I\u0027ve also seen where this may have been a bug in the esproj version.\n\nThere are many variations of implementations and work arounds I\u0027ve seen, but all seem quite over complicated and give me pause as surely Microsoft has an intended pattern for this.\n\nI have tried conditional XML in csproj to handle multiple build configurations, which dynamically run correct package.json commands during local dev. I\u0027ve even made the SpaProxyLaunchCommand and ServerUrl conditional, based on build configuration to prevent the dev server from being started. This then leads to the need to manually copy files from the esproj. However, I\u0027ve not been able to correctly ensure esproj gets built (or finished running a package.json command) before copying the files when hitting F5 - this process only works when doing an explicit build.\n\nIn summary, here\u0027s what I\u0027m looking for:\n\n1. Microsoft\u0027s intended pattern for running .net Core 8 SPA in prod mode, locally, without dev server (PWA testing, etc)\n2. If environment or build specific code is required in startup.cs, this should be documented.\n3. If environment or build specific code is required in esproj, or csproj, this should be documented.\n\ncc: @guardrex https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/35703",

We are often debugging service worker related functionality, which requires running in prod mode, and https. \n\nWe have managed to get around the issue in the meantime. In older versions, we could manually build from the cli, change aspnetcore_environemnt to production, and change the startup profile to IIS Express. The startup.cs code would detect production as the environment and thus not run the angular dev server, and IIS Express would serve up the index.html. But even this required a fairly undocumented chunk of XML in the csproj that would copy the webpack files elsewhere, and would require use of conditions to do so, using configuration variables. \n\ncsproj file, angular.json, startup.cs / program.cs, package.json, esproj file.. one must understand how all of these relate, where files are published, how commands are run. The esproj itself takes some time to wrap one\u0027s head around. It seems there\u0027s no guarantee during a build of the solution that the esproj build completes prior to the main project. As well, the esproj \u003cBuildCommand\u003e only seems to execute during a build, but not a publish. \n\nIt\u0027s not that any of this are problems in themselves, it\u0027s just so much of it is undocumented, or the documentation buried or unclear. \n\nThe north star should be, imo: publishing isn\u0027t required for local development, including \"prod mode\" since prod mode is required for service worker, which are growing in popularity. \n\nHopefully that makes sense...",

                                           "body":  "@MackinnonBuck \n\nSorry, a point of clarity, I misspoke. It used to be the case that angular did not at all support service worker except in a prod build. That\u0027s no longer the case from angular side. We were able to get service worker running in non prod mode, but still had a console warning indicating it was running in prod mode, even in production. Two separate issues and I failed to communicate that in my last post. \n\nNotwithstanding, angular dev server itself doesn\u0027t support Service Worker. Angular documentation recommends using https-server package instead. In a .net core SPA app, IIS Express is the optimal choice. \n\nAs it turns out, using new SPA template for angular, ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES points to Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy, which in turn starts the dev server. Dev server sets the internal angular _devMode variable to true, and you wind up with a browser console message indicating angular is running in dev mode, even though it may be a production build. This seems to trip many people up based on reddit and stackoverflow posts. \n\nThe hosting assemblies bit is hardly documented, at least with regards to configuring a new SPA project. Removing this reference then requires a manual CLI build if using IIS Express and manual copy of files to wwwroot, because building the csproj apparently does not build the esproj first despite having a project reference to it. If it did, a manual build wouldn\u0027t be required as the esproj would output to the dist folder where IIS expects to find it. \n\nBeyond that, there is almost no documentation on how to dynamically handle multiple environments for both running local and during publish. Everyone seems to handle it a bit differently, especially as the versions of angular and .net core have advanced. \n\nIn older SPA templates, there was a PublishWebpack XML step that could be updated to use conditional logic and build variables to dynamically build based on aspnetcore_environment or configuration value. That code would ensure the client side files were build and in the proper dist folder location, where IIS Express would then look during launch, and the site would run. \n\nIn this new template, that XML chunk is gone. The esproj now has BuildCommand, but apparently this is only used during Publish / Deployment - not during launch in visual studio. Conversely, The csproj has SpaProxyLaunchCommand, but nothing pertaining to publish / deployment, and also does not wait for esproj to build before completing it\u0027s own build, despite having a project reference. Thus requiring (still) a manual build and a copying of dist into wwwroot in the csproj before running IIS Express. This is the part we\u0027ve not been able to find an elegant solution for. \n\nHere is what we\u0027ve done today to support multiple environments during local runs as well as publish / deployments:\n\n1. Adding new configurations (Dev, Test, Prod) via Configuration Manager for the solution, and the projects)\n2. Updating csproj SpaProxyLaunchCommand to \"npm run start:$(Configuration.ToLower())\"\n3. Removing the Spa reference for startup hosting assemblies for IIS Express profile\n4. Update to scripts in package.json. Added start:dev, start:test, start:prod. the executable command for each being a combination of the start:windows and the prestart value, but with an additional -c=development / test / prod respectively. Then removed start:windows, start:default, and prestart. This allows the csproj to call an environment specific startup script, which spins up aspnetcore-https, ng serve, and certificates.\n5. Update esproj BuildCommand to \"npm run build:$(Configuration.ToLower())\"\n6. Update to scripts in package.json. Added build:dev, build:test, build:prod so the above command is dynamic and builds with correct environment\n\nWith all of this in place, we can now select a configuration option in visual studio via the drop down on the toolbar and run for most tasks. \n\nWhen debugging service worker though, we select the configuration we want, but then must manually build the esproj or build manually via cli. Once the dist/browser folder is populated with updated files, we manually copy those to the csproj wwwroot folder, change startup profile to IIS Express, and we\u0027re good. \n\nTo recap, the files involved in all of this:\n\n- esproj\n- csproj\n- package.json\n- angular.json\n- launchSettings\n\nand requires knowledge of:\n\n- msbuild steps\n- msbuild variables\n- csproj xml schema\n- esproj xml schema\n- angular configuration\n- configuration manager\n- hosting assemblies\n- launch profiles\n- SpaProxy\n- Differences in SPA template and .net core SPA versions, in order to discern applicable help resources on the web\n\nOverall, there\u0027s little to no documentation on the workflow / setup for supporting multiple environments in a .Net Core SPA template, but there is entire sections on multiple environments for .Net Core itself. Consumers of the template are left to figure this out themselves. My hope was that someone who worked on these teams might have a \"best practice\" workflow and configuration strategy to handle this and would be willing to document it. \n\nAt this point, I feel the biggest blocker is that when building the solution or the csproj, the esproj build command is not called, and the dist files are not produced, and not copied to wwwroot where IISExpress expects to find them - and seemingly no documented way to automate the copying. \n\n\n",
