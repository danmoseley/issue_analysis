The challenges I described in the previous comment are still unresolved. We would probably need help from the teams which own VS, the runtime host, and the SDK to completely resolve this. It\u0027s extremely unlikely this will land in 3.0. 3.1 or 5.0 is a more appropriate timeframe for this.\r\n\r\nWhat we have now in the code currently is a workaround for this. There is a post-build step which manually alters the metadata in .nuspec file in NuGet packages to remove incorrect `\u003cdependency\u003e` items and add a `\u003cframeworkReference\u003e`. IMO it would be ideal if `dotnet pack` produced the right nuspec in the first place so this post-build hack wasn\u0027t necessary.\r\n\r\nThe other major workaround we have is that test projects don\u0027t actually run against the shared framework bits that ship to customers. The host doesn\u0027t provide a way to easily swap in a new shared framework, so test projects run on ASP.NET Core binaries as if they are simple class libraries projects. This means test code isn\u0027t actually executing the same crossgened binaries that ship to customers.",

        "body":  "Currently, running build.cmd doesn\u0027t build everything in this repo. You have to know about special parameters to get the repo build Debian, RPM, and Windows installers.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**: let\u0027s make `build.cmd`/`.sh` without arguments build everything in the repo. That includes:\r\n\r\n* C#, C++, TypeScript, and Java projects\r\n* On Windows, MSI installers. \r\n* On Linux, the installer that matches the current platform (deb, rpm, tar.gz, etc.)\r\n\r\n**Tricky bits**: this is not trivial because we have some tricky requirements.\r\n* the Windows Server Hosting bundle needs to include both the x64 and x86 versions of ASP.NET Core. Should build.cmd on Windows compile both x64 and x86, or just one?\r\n* Pre-requisites. To build everything, you need .NET 3.5 (for the Wix Toolset), NodeJS, the JDK, Visual Studio, Windows SDKs, and more. We don\u0027t have scripts to install or acquire all of these automatically. We should add scripts which check early on for these prerequisties because builds will often fail with confusing messages later if prereqs are not met.\r\n",

Return value 3.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nI\u0027m not 100% sure, I haven\u0027t been able to narrow down the condition. The installer woks on most of our servers, but on two servers it doesn\u0027t.\r\n\r\nServers:\r\nWindows 2012 R2 Standard Version 6.3 (Build 9600)\r\nIIS Version 8.5.9600.16384\r\nARR 3.0.1750\r\n(Screenshots \u0026 systeminfo below)\r\n\r\n1. Using Installer dotnet-hosting-2.2.0-win.exe\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/169953/58852282-c1490200-864a-11e9-98b9-2d969d848ca8.png)\r\n\r\n2. Run the installer from the GUI or by command line and this is the resulting error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/169953/58852310-e2a9ee00-864a-11e9-99ac-61c515dd758e.png)\r\n\r\nWhen running from the command line, the installation fails during the first installation dotnet-hosting-2.2.0-win.exe-install_000_AspNetCoreModule_x64.log:\r\n[dotnet-hosting-2.2.0-win.exe-install_000_AspNetCoreModule_x64.log](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/files/3250582/dotnet-hosting-2.2.0-win.exe-install_000_AspNetCoreModule_x64.log)\r\n\r\nAnd, dotnet-hosting-2.2.0-win.exe-install.log:\r\n[dotnet-hosting-2.2.0-win.exe-install.log](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/files/3250584/dotnet-hosting-2.2.0-win.exe-install.log)\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot of appwiz.cpl (I figure the logs might have more information):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/169953/58852460-7976aa80-864b-11e9-8bd2-b8142bdfe474.png)\r\n\r\nsysteminfo:\r\n[systeminfo.txt](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/files/3250624/systeminfo.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI expected the installation to complete successfully. Here are logs from another server that \"should\" have the same configuration as the first server.

        "body":  "My understanding is that our CI servers now only run automated tests against release builds. If that\u0027s the case, this means that the many Debug.Asserts throughout the AspNetCore repo are pretty worthless since we can only ever see an assertion failures by running tests or samples locally even the Debug.Asserts in the test projects themselves.\r\n\r\nI think the best solution is to run our automated tests against debug builds. I\u0027m not asking for *all* our testing to be done against debug builds, but nightly tests of debug builds would probably be a good idea.\r\n\r\n@davidfowl suggested using critical logs to replace Debug.Asserts. That was definitely the right approach for #11624, but in a lot of places we assert currently we don\u0027t have a logger. There\u0027s also the problem that not all our tests will fail given a critical log, but a lot will.\r\n\r\nChanging Debug.Asserts to Trace.Asserts seems like a somewhat reasonable idea, but not only does that create performance concerns, it could also potentially introduce new DoS vectors as @benaadams rightfully [pointed out](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/pull/11624#issuecomment-506105907).",

It theoretically would magnify existing flakiness slightly by giving flaky tests and extra couple chances to fail, but we need to drive those down anyway.\r\n\r\nWe should also make sure we know the behavior and diagnosability of `Debug.Assert` in our test code. In the past it\u0027s failed in hard-to-understand ways (\"Test Run Aborted\" errors, etc.).\r\n\r\n\u003e suggested using critical logs to replace Debug.Asserts.\r\n\r\nWhy not both? We could have a helper that writes a critical log (for Release) and does a `Debug.Assert` (for Debug).",

Separate `*.csproj` projects that depend only on the SharedFramework.wixproj or TargetingPack.wixproj could work like other C# projects with custom `*.nuspec` files. It would mean two more projects and four more project invocations (one for each Windows `$(Platform)` per project) but removes a download.\r\n\r\nNote that since the new C# projects would depend only on WiX projects, they\u0027d need to run in desktop `msbuild`. Complicating things with a switch back to `dotnet msbuild` and discovery of the `*.msi` files et cetera doesn\u0027t seem worthwhile. That is, let\u0027s do this as long as it\u0027s a simplification.\r\n\r\n(Putting this on the aspnet-build project and not the DoI one because this infrastructure directly affects few devs.)\r\n\r\n/cc @dotnet/aspnet-build ",

Please describe.\r\n\r\nThis week, the number of passed tests as part of our daily CI builds and PR checks this week decreased from [~85,000](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=758545\u0026view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab) to [~20,000](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=760441\u0026view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab). Despite this, the PR checks passed an the build stayed green.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54385/89686643-93e18f00-d8b3-11ea-860e-1c58bd88999a.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54385/89686800-dc00b180-d8b3-11ea-8ab5-a332939a30e3.png)\r\n\r\nThe tests stopped running because of an issue with xunit/arcade (see https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/5908) that caused `dotnet test` runs to fail silently, but I think automated checks should have caught the dramatic reduction in the number of passed tests.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\n\r\nWe should set some sort of minimum threshold on the number of passed tests for a CI build/PR check pass. If we ever intentionally reduce the number of tests we run intentionally, we can manually adjust this threshold.\r\n",

So, I can share some info about my particular workflow.\r\n\r\nThe best starting point for testing is to identify the unit tests local to the area you\u0027re changing. Usually, there\u0027s a `test` directory adjacent to the `src` directory where you are making the modification. You can find tests by querying for places where the API you\u0027ve changed is being invoked inside a test directory. If you know what feature you want to work on, I can help you find where to make the test change.\r\n\r\nWIth regard to testing in a real application, there are various `sample` directories in the repo that contain apps that you can run that will hook up locally to the build.\r\n\r\nI typically will test development changes using the process listed above but that\u0027s usually if I\u0027m trying to validate some larger E2E scenario.",

To avoid repeatedly stating that users can run the `build.cmd` command in the directory, we\u0027ll instead refer to the \"build subset of code\" section in the top-level docs so we have less duplication there. We should still include any project-specific build instructions like helpful flags to pass to the build command or dependencies that need to be installed.\r\n\r\nDitto for the test section.",

The general idea would be to have our installer interact with the restart manager session. Would shut IIS down gracefully near the start of that session then start it again once the update is done. May find the update wants to reboot to get rid of other locked files but it should be manageable.\r\n\r\nAnother wrinkle @joeloff and I discussed was fact the hosting bundle doesn\u0027t store its command-line settings anywhere. Would likely require us to write a setup component that writes the details out e.g. into the registry. As @joeloff said,\r\n\u003e If we remember the setting per major.minor version we should be good to support SxS installs of say 6.0 and 7.1 or whatever\r\n\r\nNote: He didn\u0027t mean the ANCM version there because that installation is per-system. Would need to keep updating to the latest and greatest the (incredibly rare) times we need to service that as well as as we do major releases.\r\n\r\nMain issue might be with on-premises server farms because they\u0027d need to be updated in waves to maintain service. In addition, I\u0027m not sure if individual web applications _also_ need to interact with the restart manager.",

Deployed some new code a month ago to an IIS server and got it running.\r\n\r\nYesterday, decided to deploy my latest version to the IIS server. Pushed the button, Visual studio chugged away, built and uploaded files (same saved settings from before). Made sure db was updated. Site does not run. 500 error.\r\n\r\nChecked event log, and I see this:\r\n\r\n_Could not load configuration. Exception message:\r\nUnable to get required configuration section \u0027system.webServer/aspNetCore\u0027. Possible reason is web.config authoring error._\r\n\r\nI am relatively new to this, so I search, and try everything:\r\n\r\n- Checked the web.config. Is present, and correct (VS put it there, I have not touched it, so as expected)\r\n- Updated hosting bundle to latest .net 7\r\n- Recycled, restarted, rebooted\r\n- Tried deploying app as self contained instead of framework-dependent\r\n- Made double, triple sure the web had full control permissions for the pass through auth account for the app pool (I am very familiar with .NET web forms / framework on IIS)\r\n- Cleared all files from the web, republished\r\n\r\nReally tearing my hair out now. Luckily, this is only dev code, not a client site. But I am out of ideas. There are no logs (even though I turned it on in web.config, just get nothing). Only event viewer, and the error that it cannot read the section, which is present, means I am completely out of ideas.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am unlucky, but this doesn\u0027t seem like production ready code. The ASPnetcore support in IIS seems hacky, not baked in like .NET framework is. So if you cannot get it to even pick up the .net core section from the web.config, there really is nowhere to go.\r\n\r\nI am going to try uninstalling EVERYTHING and doing this again from the start, install web hosting bundle, set up new site, etc. But it looks from reading above that this problem has existed for a long time and is not fixed.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me the Visual Studio publish process is deficient, if it gets to the end and says success, when the site won\u0027t even run. Surely it\u0027s supposed to check basic stuff like this? Give some useful feedback if anything is wrong, files are locked, framework is missing or defective?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Just uninstalled both the .NET 6 and .NET 7 bundles on the server. Didn\u0027t reboot. Installed the .NET 7 bundle again. Go to URL, site loads first time.\r\n\r\nI might try and deploy again later to see if same result. Not the end of the world if I have to uninstall and install again, but really shouldn\u0027t be this way. Also, I was assuming if site was built \u0027self-contained\u0027 that the hosting pack is not required? Or maybe that is not the case?",

I don\u0027t think `dotnet/runtime` should be referencing CommitHash and SourceCommitUrl metadata because these aren\u0027t \"typical\" items - they are only items that are specific to ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nAnd since this information is duplicated, it feels more correct that ASP.NET just not generate the duplicate information in the first place.",

On Windows I was able to do all of this via winget eventually (after lot of searching) and probably a lot faster then following the various websites. On Linux it feels even worse - ended up searching how to do it via apt-get mostly.\r\nBut I must admit I never worked with nodejs and so on, so maybe this is just me doing it for the first time.\r\nLastly - I was trying this on Windows and Linux WSL. The WSL seems to cause issues for the Selenium based tests - I think I installed everything per the doc (but I could be wrong) and the Selenium tests were still failing for me.\r\nI guess there\u0027s a bit of a weird dichotomy to the document - it starts explaining git in relative detail. But then the section on installing pre-reqs is often very short - especially nodejs which is basically just a link. I like that at least on Windows Java can be installed by a script - that helps a lot. Would be nice to have the same for Linux.\r\nVery last minor nit: I use PowerShell even on Linux, but the PS scripts in the repo fail in weird ways when used on Linux (didn\u0027t investigate why). For example the activate.ps1 misbehaves - and the shell script is not a replacement since it won\u0027t do me any good when in PS.\r\nP.S.: I find it \"funny\" that the repo requires two competing stacks to build (NodeJS and Java). Maybe a short sentence on what they\u0027re used for?",

Then they use chrome driver which must match the version of the installed Chrome. This means editing `src\\Shared\\E2ETesting\\selenium-config.json` - also note that the version of the chrome driver typically doesn\u0027t match exactly the version of Chrome. I was able to find the matching version here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. For Chrome 101 it is `101.0.4951.41`. So edit the json file to contain that version number. Then rerun `yarn` in the `E2ETest` directory to install the new chrome driver.",

It\u0027s not split by operating system but by editor/platform choice which ends up having a bigger impact on setup.\r\n\r\n\u003e One has to use the InstallVisualStudio.ps1 even if only to update existing install. The .vsconfig in the repo root is not enough for even the restore.cmd to work.\r\n\r\nThis is clarified in Step 2 of the [VS on Windows docs](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/BuildFromSource.md#visual-studio-on-windows) but we can make it a little clearer with a warning call out.\r\n\r\n\u003e It\u0027s necessary to install NodeJS 16 LTS, installing the latest 18 will not work it seems\r\n\r\nYeah, the rule is that at least NodeJS LTS is required but higher versions are allowed. We\u0027ve avoided documenting the specific version in the docs since it is easy for it to grow out of sync with the version that is required in the various `package.json` files.\r\n\r\n\u003e For building a specific project some team members suggested to use just .dotnet\\dotnet build - that doesn\u0027t work in many cases (for example the IIS subtree doesn\u0027t build this way). One has to use the .\\eng\\build.cmd -Projects command to build.\r\n\r\nI think the IIS is the exception, not the norm, so it might be sufficient to document that it specifically needs `./build.cmd` always in its individual README.\r\n\r\n\u003e Selenium tests require Chrome, which will typically install latest version (at the time of writing this comment it is 101). Then they use chrome driver which must match the version of the installed Chrome. This means editing src\\Shared\\E2ETesting\\selenium-config.json - also note that the version of the chrome driver typically doesn\u0027t match exactly the version of Chrome. I was able to find the matching version here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. For Chrome 101 it is 101.0.4951.41. So edit the json file to contain that version number. Then rerun yarn in the E2ETest directory to install the new chrome driver.\r\n\r\nIt feels like the right fix here is to make sure that our `selenium-config` is pointing to the right build so that users don\u0027t have to manually edit the file.  We could probably add this verification as an additional validation for our existing build-ops task around keeping these Selenium dependencies up-to-date.\r\n\r\n\u003e When using the InstallJdk.ps1 the PATH must point to something like \u003crepos\u003e\\aspnetcore\\.tools\\jdk\\win-x64\\bin, so it has to have the bin appended unlike the JAVA_HOME which should point to \u003crepos\u003e\\aspnetcore\\.tools\\jdk\\win-x64.\r\n\r\nFor this feedback, I think we can include it as a note in the new JDK dependency section at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body":  "From PR comment: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/42143#issuecomment-1154757891\r\n\r\n\u003e @HaoK: Not strongly suggesting you do this, but seeing all the instances of SkipOnHelix, and all the logic around computing launch settings. I started wondering if the https tests were split into derived (class i.e. MvcHttpsTemplateTest), it might reduce some of the duplication, as you could have a property controlling whether all the tests were doing Https or not rather than having 2 permutations of every test, and could move the SkipOnHelix to the https class as well. Food for thought anyways\r\n\r\n\u003e @DamianEdwards: Yeah this is kind of the problem with these tests is they grow so organically over time and it\u0027s easiest to just copy/paste/add-dimension, not to mention that often when there\u0027s a Helix issue the tests get tactically refactored to allow disabling only the affected tests on Helix. They could certainly be refactored in places but honestly there\u0027s a time/effort-element here as well.\r\n\r\n\u003e @HaoK: Yeah I think maybe we should just have a chore/tracking issue to refactor the tests, definitely shouldn\u0027t do it in this PR, but I think these are getting near that unwieldy point where a refactor pass might make sense soon, especially if any more permutations are added\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body":  "The Shared Framework and Windows Hosting bundle installers have some issues we should address. Main issues are\r\n\r\n# Sizes and verbosity\r\n\r\n- over-verbose full names e.g. \"Build alpha.1.22514.10\" isn\u0027t that useful in most cases but shows up repeatedly\r\n- truncated strings, even in English\r\n  - this shows up primarily in the installer titles and relates to the Build information mentioned above\r\n  - the Welcome message in the Windows Hosting bundle is also less tall which doesn\u0027t leave room for \"Server Hosting\"\r\n  - some text in the Success page of the Windows Hosting bundle is taller than in the Shared Framework bundle but I\u0027m not sure which is better\r\n\r\nMaking the thm.xml files more consistent and changing how we use `$(BrandingVersionSuffix)` will address the above issues.\r\n\r\n## Example installer pages:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6431421/196060999-a69f72a2-d399-4469-95e6-dc7fb4b87853.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6431421/196061031-b17b5cd6-8cd3-4191-b6e7-08a0b08d9239.png)\r\nThis image is not resized; the Windows Hosting bundle really is much less wide.\r\n\r\n# Latest hot key updates are inconsistent and cause conflicts for some languages\r\n\r\nHot key updates from #43956 introduced new problems in some page / language combinations. For example, in Italian, the “Annulla” (Cancel) hot key is now “U” in a few places where it was previously “A” but at least one Cancel key remains “A” – causing a new inconsistency. And, in Turkish, the “Kaldır” (Uninstall) hot key is now “K” where it was previously “A” but “Kapat” (Close) on the same screen remans “K” – causing a new conflict.\r\n\r\nNeed to check the other hot key changes to confirm those changes are everything that needs a fix. Then, file loc issues to make the actual changes.\r\n\r\n# Confusing unused strings and pages in WiX sources\r\n\r\nWe have a number of strings that appear to be either completely unreferenced or unnecessary. For example, the Options pages in these installers are present in the thm.xml files and have corresponding strings in the thm.wxl files but the page is completely disabled through `SuppressOptionsUI=\"yes\"` in our `bal:WixStandardBootstrapperApplication` elements. (These bundles install components in multiple hard-coded locations.)\r\n\r\nShould remote the Options page from our thm.xml files, remove related strings and anything else we find is unused, then try an official build to confirm we didn\u0027t remove too much.\r\n\r\n# Late errors\r\n\r\n- Shared Framework bundle installer does not fail immediately when using an incompatible installer e.g. ARM64 on an x64 machine\r\n  - fails after clicking Install; is it possible to move the checks earlier❔\r\n\r\n# Minor: Add more loc comments\r\n\r\nShould comment at least to ensure \"Web Developer Tools\" is locked (if we need that resource) and `[\\[]directory[[/]]` doesn\u0027t confuse future loc team members into locking \"directory\".",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nOn a 64-bit machine where the core Runtime 6.0.11 and the ASP.NET Runtime 6.0.11 are already installed (both x64 and x86), running the Hosting Bundle 6.0.11 installer with the `OPT_NO_RUNTIME=1 OPT_NO_SHAREDFX=1` parameters results in the ASP.NET Runtime x64 being **uninstalled** (but only that one runtime; core runtimes x64 and x86, as well as ASP.NET runtime x86 remain installed).\r\n\r\nWith .NET 7 the problem is worse. In a similar scenario, on a machine with 7.0.0 core and ASP.NET runtimes installed, running the Hosting Bundle 7.0.0 installer with `OPT_NO_RUNTIME=1 OPT_NO_SHAREDFX=1` causes the uninstallation of both x64 runtimes (core and ASP.NET).\r\n\r\nThe problem first started happening with the Hosting Bundle 6.0.5. Version 6.0.4 is the last one to behave correctly.\r\n\r\nIt seems this happens only if the existing installed runtime is the same version as the Hosting Bundle being installed. When runtimes 6.0.5 were installed and Hosting Bundle 6.011 was invoked the problem did not occur (no runtimes got uninstalled).\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe Hosting Bundle installer invoked with `OPT_NO_RUNTIME=1 OPT_NO_SHAREDFX=1` should not touch any existing installations of the core Runtime or ASP.NET Runtime (regardless of their bitness).\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nInitial machine configuration:\r\n- a clean installation of Windows 10 Enterprise 21H2 x64\r\n- minimal IIS installed via `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-StaticContent -All`\r\n- all steps done in Windows PowerShell\r\n\r\nHelper function used in all cases:\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction DownloadAndInstall\r\n{\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n

Please describe the problem.\n\nToday customers targeting self-contained applications download the runtime packs at build time. This prevents offline scenarios with Visual Studio. This also impacts internal customers that install pre-release builds.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nExpand the existing runtime pack infrastructure used in the runtime repo today to the aspnet and windows desktop runtime packs.\r\n\r\n- Do similar authoring to what exists in the runtime repo\r\n  - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/78f5a9839ac7d49a3cfaa6f4015a90b1cc846fa1/src/mono/nuget/Microsoft.NET.Workload.Mono.Toolchain.Manifest/WorkloadManifest.json.in#L131\r\n- provide better descriptions than what is in the runtime repo\r\n- Update the VS setupauthoring (see mail thread for link to existing authoring) to add the runtime pack as an optional component\r\n- Add the baseline manifest into the installer repo\r\n  - https://github.com/dotnet/installer/blob/main/src/redist/targets/BundledManifests.targets\r\n\r\nDrawbacks are that this could impact servicing codeflow in the future.  The recommendation is to only produce these for windows versions that VS ships on (the idea being we still download for cross-compiling but for the RID that matches the OS, we can provide that to VS).\r\n\r\nSee email or ask marcpop for more details \n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Conceptually, they are meant to represent optional components for .NET which allows us to ship a core SDK that doesn\u0027t need to be huge while also having the smarts in the tools to know when they are needed and missing and prompt the user to install them (e.g. by giving actionable errors on the CLI or by launching the acquisition experience inside the IDE).\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that workloads are really useful when you need to ship tooling (custom MSBuild SDKs, tasks, and targets), which makes sense for ASP.NET Core.\r\n\r\nI believe originally we had a goal to provide WinForms/WPF and ASP.NET Core as workloads too but we cut it because (1) we already ship them and (2) we needed to focus on the mobile experiences. It sounds like @marcpopMSFT is suggesting we\u0027re doing them for .NET 8?",

You\u0027re issue seems to be mainly that you\u0027re mixing [Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks 7.0.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks#dependencies-body-tab) with a net6.0 target framework. This forces you to use it as a netstandard2.0 dependency since there\u0027s only a net7.0 and no net6.0 dependency.\r\n\r\nWhen used as a netstandard2.0 dependency on net6.0, you apparently need [Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces#readme-body-tab) because we call `DisposeAsync` in `DefaultHealthCheckService.RunCheckAsync`, but `RunCheckAsync` gets skipped if there are no registrations.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/63a0251075468508022d900eb8e1e277c84bf4f5/src/HealthChecks/HealthChecks/src/DefaultHealthCheckService.cs#L78-L81\r\n\r\n```text\r\nSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException: \u0027Could not load file or assembly \u0027Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces, Version=7.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51\u0027.

Upgrading your app to target net7.0, so Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks can be used as a net7.0 depencency.\r\n2. Downgrading your Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks dependency to 6.0.14, so it can be used as a net6.0 dependency.\r\n3. Manually adding the `\u003cPackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces\" Version=\"7.0.0\" /\u003e` package reference that Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks probably should have added transitively for you.\r\n\r\nOur recommendation is always to try to keep versions aligned if possible since that will keep you on the most well-tested path, but I still think we should probably add Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces as a netstandard2.0 dependency for this package.\r\n\r\n@dotnet/dnceng @dotnet/aspnet-build.

So it\u0027s breaking if a package exposes a dependency on one framework but not on a compatible framework.\r\n\r\nThe package \"at fault\" here is `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions`.  That package included a reference to AsyncInterfaces, but did not include it on frameworks where it is not needed:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/b68fd882623b528fd4ef78b122209710f17bacdb/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions.csproj#L29\r\n`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions` was what exposed AsyncInterfaces to  HealthChecks.\r\n\r\nThis has come up before and my recollection was that we intentionally have this gap where we will drop the polyfill packages in newer frameworks because the tradeoff of having the missing dependency that *might* be needed in some combinations of framework targeting is better than *forcing* all developers to carry the polyfill even after it\u0027s no longer needed.  I can\u0027t find any of these issues, but I do recall a few.  Maybe @joperezr remembers.\r\n\r\nAs was suggested -- the safe thing to do is for any library that uses the polyfill to directly reference it.  I wonder if we could force that by hiding the package from compile (`PrivateAssets=\"Compile\"`) though chances are that would be another case of making it harder for the common case to better handle the edge case.\r\n\r\n",

There are consequences / trade-offs / side-effects of mixing bands, but it is supported so long as you do not downgrade.  Good examples of this are packages like System.Text.Json - we explicitly put new features and API in this package so that folks can use it on .NETStandard / .NETFramework (and older .NET versions).\r\n\r\nSome of the consequences of using newer packages on older frameworks:\r\n1. Your application will carry more dependencies with it instead of using the version in the framework.  This can result in a larger app size.\r\n2. Similar to 1, when carrying the dependency in your app you\u0027re responsible for servicing it.  For example: if you use the System.Text.Json in the framework you target you don\u0027t need to update your app when the library updates.  You can depend on the framework updating it.  If you use the package from a newer framework, you need to update your app when new versions of the package ship with important updates.\r\n3. The adhoc combination of packages could result in situations that have less test coverage.  You might find issues that we didn\u0027t catch during the product development cycle.  Those issues will need to be brought to servicing which has a higher bar. \r\n4. It\u0027s possible for the newer band to go out of support before the older framework which would force the app to move to an even newer band when the previous one went out of support.  This happened with 3.1 / 5.0.  5.0 went out of support before 3.1, so an app might want to stay on 3.1 but would need to update a package to 6.0 to keep getting updates.\r\n\r\nAdding PackageReferences for anything that\u0027s directly consumed by your assembly is actually a *best practice* since it insulates you from changes made by your dependencies.  You can *know* you will need that PackageReference because it appears as an assembly dependency in your metadata.  That won\u0027t change unless you rebuild the library.\r\nI\u0027ve heard customers actually try to enforce \"absolute\" direct references through analyzers to achieve this: remove any direct references that aren\u0027t directly used and promote indirect references to direct references if they are directly used.  Some see this as undesirable since it adds more references to the project file, while others see this as desirable because it provides the accurate representation of every dependency of the library.  \r\n\r\nIn other words, I recommend option 5 as well. It\u0027s not only low risk, but it\u0027s also best practice IMO.  \r\n",

So hosted builds on clean machines won\u0027t see a huge gain but locally when you\u0027re doing implicit restores before builds on large project trees, there are big gains.  When testing against 700+ projects, no-op restore dropped from 30 seconds to 9.  So the more projects you have, the more performance gains you\u0027ll see.",

To move forward I think we\u0027d need to change Arcade to get that compatible with NuGet/MSBuild static graph construction.",

IDE0005 is set to `suggestion` (or lower) severity\r\n2. `GenerateDocumentationFile` is set to true\r\n\r\nNote that it is trivial to meet the second requirement by using the XML `\u003cPropertyGroup\u003e` syntax shown in the first post. With those three specific documentation warnings disabled, `GenerateDocumentationFile` will only produce new warnings in the build if you have _invalid_ XML comments already contained in source code.\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to \"work around\" this issue by trying to disable the `EnableGenerateDocumentationFile`, then it will not be successful because that approach is effectively the same as option (1) - it causes IDE0005 to be silently disabled.\r\n\r\n\u003e I cant disable IDE0005 completely\r\n\r\nIf `EnableGenerateDocumentationFile` is showing up in your build, then IDE0005 is already disabled, even though the project asked for it to be enabled. The warning is alerting developers to the fact that the compiler cannot provide the functionality that the project has explicitly requested because the project is incorrectly configured.",

This will not fix the problem, but will instead directly instruct the build to produce an incorrect output. If you do not want to enable documentation output, the only currently-correct solution is to reduce the severity of IDE0005 to suggestion. If customers keep trying to work around this issue by disabling EnableGenerateDocumentationFile, we will likely be forced to rename the diagnostic or add a new diagnostic to force it to appear again.\r\n\r\n\u003e I would like to have IDE0005 enabled, but I don\u0027t want to enable \"GenerateDocumentationFile\"\r\n\r\nThis is not possible today, but there is an open feature request to make it possible:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/26938\r\n\r\n\u003e I don\u0027t see how IDE0005 and \"GenerateDocumentationFile\" are related, it should be perfectly fine to enable just one and not other.\r\n\r\nNote that this is literally the reason why the `EnableGenerateDocumentationFile` warning exists.

I want to compare against a working build.\r\n\r\nEssentially, `$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)=obj\\` which is because, IIUC, `$(UseArtifactsOutput)=\u0027\u0027` and thus it picks a relative path. So, all the trimming projects like `/mnt/vss/_work/1/s/artifacts/bin/trimmingTests/projects/Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.TrimmingTests/TestCertificateXmlEncryptor/project.csproj` end up getting this relative path for the intermediate assembly - `obj/Releaes/net9.0/linux-x64/project.dll`.\r\n\r\nThe sdk uses artifacts path if `UseArtifactsOutput=\u0027true\u0027` or `$(ArtifactsPath)!=\u0027\u0027`. I don\u0027t know if something for this changed recently in the sdk, or arcade. We could set either of these, and maybe that will fix the issue. But it would be useful to check against any working runs that we might have with the same repo+branch.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nFor ASP.NET Core in a source-build context, there are two goals that are generally in tension with each other:\r\n\r\n- Ease of development: ASP.NET Core developers want to use the best tools for development, including the best bundling tools, linting tools, and anything else that makes it easier to build, test and release bug-free versions of ASP.NET Core with the least amount of work.\r\n- Ease of packaging: .NET maintainers want to build everything from source, without any binaries. With the javascript/npm ecosystem,that can mean having to include and build thousands of npm packages, which creates extra work.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the pain in the second point by focusing on things that are really needed in a VMR/source-build context?\r\n\r\nFor example, in a VMR/source-build context, we don\u0027t need to:\r\n\r\n- Create npm packages (like `@microsoft/signalr`) for publishing to npmjs.org\r\n- Build Windows-only components in a source-build-only context\r\n- Create nupkgs that are only published to nuget.org\r\n- Run linting tools\r\n\r\nIs there a list of packages/projects that are strictly required for creating the .NET SDK in a source-build context? Can we trim down the ASP.NET Core dependency tree (and build system) to focus on just those packages, to make it easier to source-build all of ASP.NET Core?\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

This runs as the last step end of the build, after tests have completed.\r\n\r\nWe also have Blazor Playwright tests that generate projects from the Blazor Web project templates and run them against the locally built shared framework. Since these tests run _before_ the `.nuspec` re-write, the templates fail to restore because some transient dependencies of packages they reference don\u0027t exist (they\u0027re included in the shared framework).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nWe should consider changing the `.nuspec` re-write to occur before tests are run so that generated projects can reference locally built packages which depend on the locally built shared framework.\r\n\r\n## What this enables\r\n\r\nThe Playwright template tests are currently still able to run in Helix, because local artifacts are already produced and laid out correctly by the time the tests run. However, this fix would enable non-Helix pipelines to run the template tests (like the Windows Server x64 pipeline).",

It is listed in the AMD64 side of the same repository, and is available for ARM64 as a download on the dotnet.microsoft.com site, but this requires manual dependency resolution. I found a [similar issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/29173) for v3.1, but I just assumed that since 8.0 is the latest it would be available through the official repository. Is there a specific reason for this?\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI was following the instructions on the [docs for installing .NET on Linux (Debian 12 specifically)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian#debian-12), and expected the instructions to work.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Though it wouldn’t be as ideal as it being in the Bookworm repository, it should work if it were in Ubuntu Jammy.\r\n\r\nIt’s certainly not the end of the world not being in the repository, though it would simplify management considering it’s in the amd64 bookworm repo and arm64 binaries are available elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKevin",

Grpc.Tools requires new versions of core libraries (like libm.so) that are are a part of glibc. In other words, it needs a newer glibc. glibc is the main C library. Almost everything links against it. If it is not installed, most applications (eg, bash) in common Linux distros will work. Upgrading glibc is not generally an option: it is so invasive and risky that it\u0027s probably a better idea to upgrade to a newer distro instead.",

I know VS is a product of MS, and it will be recommended but on the other side, JB rider is Superior for first-class .NET development as well. \n\nThe thing is .NET open source developers using rider should not feel stuck when contributing to the aspnetcore repository. They should get the same support, documentation, and dev utilities (i.e. `startvs.cmd`) just like Visual Studio. \n\nI started exploring this path already, but I thought let me open issue first, to grab other people thoughts on this. \n\nThanks, \nShreyas",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nAfter updating package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy from version 8.0.11 to version 9.0.0, I experience the following runtime error:\n\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[11]\n      Hosting startup assembly exception\n      System.InvalidOperationException: Startup assembly Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy failed to execute. See the inner exception for more details.\n       ---\u003e System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly \u0027Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\u0027. The system cannot find the file specified.\n      File name: \u0027Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\u0027\n         at System.Reflection.RuntimeAssembly.InternalLoad(AssemblyName assemblyName, StackCrawlMark\u0026 stackMark, AssemblyLoadContext assemblyLoadContext, RuntimeAssembly requestingAssembly, Boolean throwOnFileNotFound)\n         at System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(AssemblyName assemblyRef)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.GenericWebHostBuilder.ExecuteHostingStartups()\n\nI am running an ASP.NET project that targets framework version .NET 8.0. I verified that the project runs without error using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy version 8.0.11. If it matters, I am using the MySql.EntityFrameworkCore package version 8.0.8 to interact with a MySQL database using EntityFramework.\n\nI also had to rollback the following packages to version 8.0.11 for similar reasons:\n\n* Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\n* Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools\n\nWhen all three of these packages are rolled back, the code works again without issue.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI am running a simple API application that connects to a MySQL database. When I run/debug the application, I expect the server app to compile, and run. And I expect my front end application to be able to interact with the API to retrieve data from my database.\n\nWhen the application runs, I instead get feedback from the console that the Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy dll failed to execute, and my server code will not run.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI am working with the following project in my Github profile: https://github.com/loganmj/WorldCities\n\nIn this project, you will see that if you run the project as-is, it should startup correctly, but if you upgrade to Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy version 9.0.0, the server code fails to run, with the error as I have desribed.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n9.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\nOutput of dotnet

There are numerous issues.\n\nThis is the latest issue with latest SHA:\n\n`C:\\git\\dotnet2\\src\\aspnetcore\\src\\Components\\test\\testassets\\Components.WasmMinimal\\Components.WasmMinimal.csproj : error NU1102: Unable to find package Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.Mono.browser-wasm with version (= 10.0.0-dev) [C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Enterprise_Pre\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\NuGet\\NuGet.targets]`\n\nThis seems expected due to: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/1312da2106ecfb70100e6bdfed3af38d6b080d95/src/ProjectTemplates/TestInfrastructure/Directory.Build.props.in#L14-L20\n\nConditioning the download didn\u0027t help, as runtime json contains the pack reference with local dev version 10.0.0-dev and fails to build. Version is likely coming from project template.\n\nBack in January, when I tried to enable tests, we were not hitting this issue, but several other ones, listed below. All of those issues are likely still present, but they are masked by the issue above.\n\n## Missing test certificates\n\nAt first this was failing due to missing test certificates, required by various tests. The build is skipping the creation of those certificates due to this false condition: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/7340678143d9ade4b772bad5e3ffd0b86718706e/src/ProjectTemplates/TestInfrastructure/PrepareForTest.targets#L34-L38\n\n`MSBuildRuntimeType` is set to `Full` due to: https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/81f0f65d674c3aebd3c1ce78f2e5d831d32980f8/repo-projects/aspnetcore.proj#L19-L21\n```\n    \u003c!-- aspnetcore must be built with desktop msbuild but defaults to dotnet build. --\u003e\n    \u003cBuildArgs Condition=\"\u0027$(BuildOS)\u0027 == \u0027windows\u0027\"\u003e$(BuildArgs) -msbuildEngine vs\u003c/BuildArgs\u003e\n    \u003cForceDotNetMSBuildEngine\u003efalse\u003c/ForceDotNetMSBuildEngine\u003e\n```\n\nThis requires enabling `GenerateTestDevCert` task for .NET FX. Either by shelling out to use external tooling, or reuse some of the code from `CertificateManager`.\n\n## Tests setup - mutation of .NET SDK\n\nWith test certificates available, we get the following failures:\n`C:\\git\\dotnet\\src\\aspnetcore\\src\\ProjectTemplates\\TestInfrastructure\\PrepareForTest.targets(118,5): error MSB3030: Could not copy the file \"DontDareMutateThisSDKdotnet.exe\" because it was not found. [C:\\git\\dotnet\\src\\aspnetcore\\src\\ProjectTemplates\\test\\Templates.Blazor.WebAssembly.Auth.Tests\\Templates.Blazor.WebAssembly.Auth.Tests.csproj]`\n\nThe root cause is in this section that talks about not running tests on source-build: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/731c3b711bd81cc7c809e4e0164e8248e854f0b0/Directory.Build.props#L188-L210\n\nOne idea for fixing this: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/44843#issuecomment-2616815509\n\nFor repro, add `/p:DotNetBuildTests=true` to your Windows VMR build command, i.e.: `build -prepareMachine -c Release /p:TargetOS=windows /p:TargetArchitecture=x64 /bl /p:DotNetBuildTests=true`",

        "body":  "The \"Windows local development validation\" pipeline currently takes close to two hours to complete. We should consider if there are any high-cost+low-value validation that we can remove to make this pipeline more efficient.\n\nFor example, we might be able to optimize or remove the following steps:\n* Build (Debug): ~10 min\n* Run project template tests: ~50 minutes\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe initial motivation for adding this pipeline was that our project template tests kept getting broken by changes that passed in CI but silently broke something because either:\n* An already-quarantined tests got broken to a more severe degree, but this break was invisible\n* A scenario was only used during local development (e.g., testing a project template manually) and it didn\u0027t get validated in CI at all\n\nSo, removing the project template test stage in this pipeline might seem to counteract that initial goal. However, we recently added another pipeline that runs a test script to create a project from a template and check that it builds successfully. This probably covers the majority of what we\u0027re trying to do, minus the actually running the template.\n\nAs an alternative to removing the project template test step entirely, we could either add a test filter [on the step](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/e2151836317a0d027bf06680c59474086268c8af/.azure/pipelines/ci.yml#L656) to only test a small subset of project template tests, or we could add a new test script that runs the built project and does some basic validation on it.",

The focus has been on:\n\n🛠️ **Build time**\n🔁 **Build reliability**\n✅ **Test reliability**\n\n### 📌 Key PRs\n\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62481 – Run Template Tests only on relevant PRs\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62509 – Add “Always Green” PR check for doc-only changes\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62644 – Split Helix tests into two subsets\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/62811 – Run Components-E2E tests only on relevant PRs\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/61743 – Swapped Win11 Helix queue for Win-VS2022 queue in CI\n\n### 📊 Results (based on rolling public builds of the main branch)\n\n- ✅ Build pass rate improved from **52.3%** (past 6 months) to **76.2%** (past week)\n- 🧪 Test failure rate dropped from **0.002%** to **0.0004%** after the Helix queue switch — a **5x increase** in reliability\n- 🖥️ Weekly test failures on the new VS2022 queue: **2** (1 quarantined) vs. **29** on the old Win11 queue\n- ⏱️ Build duration reduced from **2h 25m** to **1h 11m** — more than 50% faster!\n\n### 🔍 What’s Next?\nWe\u0027re continuing to drive down flakiness in builds and tests. Next up:\n\n- Investigating common build failures like https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61178\n- Tackling remaining flaky tests\n- Continuing to update this issue with future improvements\n\n💡 **Got ideas to improve the CI experience further**? Drop them in the comments — we’d love to hear from you!",
