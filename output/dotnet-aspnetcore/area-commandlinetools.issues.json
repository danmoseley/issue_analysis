However, when you are using the iOS simulator to test that website, or even use Azure B2C authorisation, you can\u0027t use the generated certificate on the device.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is the certificate generated isn\u0027t a self-signed cert with Basic Constraint x509 extension with enabled CA option.  The dotnet certs tool should provide the option to create this type of certificate.

        "body":  "### Description\r\nI have an asp.net core application with a self-hosted IdentityServer component. I can convince a browser (Chrome and Firefox) to visit the site, but I\u0027m having trouble getting the IdentityServer component to be able to talk back to localhost due to certificate errors, specifically:\r\n```\r\nfail: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.JwtBearerHandler[3]\r\n      Exception occurred while processing message.\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: IDX20803: Unable to obtain configuration from: \u0027https://localhost:44303/.well-known/openid-configuration\u0027. ---\u003e System.IO.IOException: IDX20804: Unable to retrieve document from: \u0027https://localhost:44303/.well-known/openid-configuration\u0027. ---\u003e System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception. ---\u003e System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.\r\n```\r\nI realise that certificate installation can differ from distro to distro, however, I\u0027ve tried this first on my (more native) Gentoo, and also in an Ubuntu vm:\r\n\r\n1. export the dev cert to a pfx with `dotnet dev-certs https -ep /tmp/dnc.pfx -p SomePassword`\r\n2. extract the crt from the pfx with `openssl pkcs12 -in /tmp/dnc.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out /tmp/dnc.crt`\r\n3. copy to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates and run update-ca-certificates. In both cases (Gentoo and Ubuntu), see a message about 1 added certificate\r\n3.5 in the case of Gentoo, I was also able to use certutil to install the crt into my ~/.pki/nssdb; in the case of Ubuntu, this dir does not exist and I\u0027m not sure how to bootstrap it\r\n4. Fire up the asp.net site with angular frontend -- on Gentoo, where certutil worked, Chrome happily visits the site; on both (iirc) I had to add a security exception for Firefox and store, but could get to the site.\r\n5. Attempts to log in fail because all auth requests go through the primary api, which then attempts to contact the same host/port (localhost:44303) for IdentityServer comms -- and that\u0027s where the failure occurs with the message above: I can get no further\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSet up an asp.net core project with self-hosted IdentityServer on Linux, such that the config for identity server points back to the same hosting application, using dev certs. Any route requiring authorization will result in a 500 error with the above logging in place. Using `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` on Windows, same code, no problem.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI expect to be able to get dotnet-to-dotnet comms working with the dev cert.

We have see that installing self-signed certificates into the trust list on Linux doesn\u0027t work because the certificate itself is usually missing some X509v3 attributes that Linux (due to OpenSssl) require but Windows doesn\u0027t.  OpenSsl on Linux requires that self-signed certificates have the \"Cert Signing\" attribute on them. This is because a self-signed, trusted certificate has to be both a valid CA certificate (requires \u0027Cert Signing\u0027) as well as a \"leaf node\" certificate.",

It is an OpenSsl change (between 1.0.2e and 1.0.2g) where self-signed certificates need to have this additional attribute set on them. Even when you install the certificate (public key portion) using \u0027update-ca-certificates\u0027 on Linux, the certificate will still not be \"trusted\" if the \"Certificate Signing\" bit is missing.\r\n\r\nThere is an open issue still on the OpenSsl repo about this problem: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/1418\r\n\r\nThis is a client-side problem. For example, I created an ASP.NET Core website using kestrel and hosted it on my Windows box. I first used the default \"ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate\" for the website. I then installed the certificate (public key portion) into the trusted certificates list on my Linux machine using \u0027update-ca-certificates\u0027.  When I used \u0027curl\u0027 to send a request to the website, I got an error.\r\n\r\nWhen I changed the website to use a self-signed certificate that has the added \"Certificate Signing\" attribute, then \u0027curl\u0027 worked from the Linux machine. \r\n\r\nI got the same results using HttpClient from the Linux machine. I got errors about the certificate when I used the default ASP.NET Core development certificate. But when I updated the certificate to include \"Certificate Signing\" then HttpClient worked again.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this investigation, we need to fix the \u0027dotnet dev-certs\u0027 tool so that it will generate a self-signed certificate that can be used on both Windows and Linux properly.  @Tratcher where is the source code to this tool? Perhaps I can submit a PR to fix that.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the default ASP.NET development certificate, you can generate your own self-signed certificate using Windows PowerShell or Linux OpenSsl tools.  Just make sure to specify the \u0027Certificate Signing\u0027 attribute in addition to other things.\r\n\r\nFor example, this is the command I used to generate a self-signed certificate on Windows.\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nNew-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName \"localhost\" -KeyUsage CertSign, DigitalSignature, KeyEncipherment -FriendlyName \"Better ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate\" -CertStoreLocation \"Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then exported the public key portion and installed that on my Linux machine and ran \u0027update-ca-certificates\u0027 to put it into the trusted list.\r\n",

So, \"clear old certificate, create new set\" will not work at all unless that new set contains the additional \u0027Certificate Signing\u0027 bit.\r\n\r\nAnd as you pointed out, the current ASP.NET \u0027dotnet dev-certs\u0027 tool is not creating a certificate that can make Linux clients happy.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    X509v3 Key Usage: critical\r\n        Digital Signature, Key Encipherment\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat Key Usage attribute is missing the \u0027Certificate Signing\u0027 bit.\r\n\r\nSo, the best fix for everyone is to 1) understand the problems that OpenSsl on Linux has regarding self-signed certificates, and 2) change our \u0027dotnet dev-certs\u0027 tool so that the automatically generated ASP.NET Core development certificate has the proper attributes so that it works on both Windows and Linux. That will reduce pain for developers.\r\n\r\ncc: @bartonjs",

The \u0027/mnt/d/localhost.crt\u0027 is the public key of the self-signed certificate that I made on the first Linux WSL machine.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:/mnt/d/dotnet/web1$ curl --cacert /mnt/d/localhost.crt https://localhost:5001/\r\nHello World!davidsh@davidsh2:/mnt/d/dotnet/web1$    \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nI then did a modification to the ASP.NET Core server I created above on the first machine. I added another mapped endpoint. This new endpoint will do an outbound request using HttpClient back to itself.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n        endpoints.MapGet(\"/outbound\", async context =\u003e\r\n        {\r\n            using var client = new HttpClient();\r\n            string result = await client.GetStringAsync(\"https://localhost:5001/\");\r\n            await context.Response.WriteAsync($\"Outbound result: {result}\\n\");\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also made sure to install the self-signed certificate (public key) portion into the machine\u0027s trusted store on this first Linux WSL machine.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:~/dotnet/web1$ sudo cp localhost.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:~/dotnet/web1$ ls /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\r\nlocalhost.crt\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:~/dotnet/web1$ sudo update-ca-certificates\r\nUpdating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...\r\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\r\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...\r\ndone.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I repeated the experiment using the second Linux WSL machine and using curl.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:/mnt/d/dotnet/web1$ curl --cacert /mnt/d/localhost.crt https://localhost:5001/outbound\r\nOutbound result: Hello World!\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, to simply things on the second Linux WSL machine, I then installed the self-signed certificate (public key) portion into its trusted store (similar to what I did on the first Linux WSL machine). Now, I can use a simpler \u0027curl\u0027 command since the certificate is now trusted on this machine:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:/mnt/d/dotnet/web1$ sudo cp /mnt/d/localhost.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:/mnt/d/dotnet/web1$ sudo update-ca-certificates\r\nUpdating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...\r\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\r\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...\r\ndone.\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:/mnt/d/dotnet/web1$ curl https://localhost:5001/outbound\r\nOutbound result: Hello World!\r\ndavidsh@davidsh2:/mnt/d/dotnet/web1$                                                                                                                                                    \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, this repro is similar to yours in that the Linux ASP.NET Core server does a TLS request back to itself.\r\n\r\nTry reproducing my results using your own Linux machines. It should work.",

We can\u0027t get past [the first sample](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstarts/1_client_credentials.html#), because of issues with SSL. Running it on Windows works fine, but most of us are using Ubuntu 20.04 as our daily driver (the actual distro, not WSL).\r\n\r\nIn terms of code, that sample link has it all. We gave up and downloaded their sample code from their GitHub repo to make sure we weren\u0027t missing something. Works great on Windows, SSL connection issues on Ubuntu machines...\r\n\r\nAll we get is \"The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception..\" But we\u0027re unable to view the inner exception. My understanding is that IS4 catches it in some deeply nested internal method and just adds the message to whatever throws this exception.\r\n\r\nSince it only occurs on Ubuntu, and not on Windows, I assumed that it was probably related to this issue, since it\u0027s occurring in development, when using `dotnet dev-certs https`\u0027s certificates (which from my understanding are self-signed).",

If I touch/force-save the project file (`DotNetWatcherIssueDemo.csproj`) then `dotnet watch` detects the change, re-builds the watch list and detects changes to the added file, but again, not for any new file added thereafter.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nOutput of `dotnet --info`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.2.101\r\n Commit:    236713b0b7\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.17134\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.2.101\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.2.0\r\n  Commit:  1249f08fed\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  1.1.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.1.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  1.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.104 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.201 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.400 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.402 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.403 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.500 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.1.502 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  2.2.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.0.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 1.1.10 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.0.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.4 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @natemcmaster ",

The only part lacking is when I want to expand my test suite with new files.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to keep adding test classes into the same file and then split them out later, but it\u0027s a bit painful. Edit: Not so bad with [the quick refactoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/move-type-to-matching-file?view=vs-2019) to move the class out to a new file when you\u0027re knocking them out later.",

The result is that `_cancelKeyPress` has already been subscribed to and then **unsubscribed to** by the time it is reached [here](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/7822425c3ea35e0bb46e57fad11663e7cbf9f850/test/dotnet-watch.Tests/Utilities/TestConsole.cs#L51), thus causing a NRE since without any subscribers, it is null. I believe the intent is that `ConsoleCancelKey` should be called while the `RunAsync` operation is happening. Is there a dotnet watch command that can cause that to happen so that this test works properly?",

        "body":  "The issue #10366 was marked as stale prematurely. I think it still makes sense to implement.\r\n\r\nRight now, the `dotnet watch test` runs all tests every time even if only one file has changed.\r\n\r\nThe test runner can already provide code coverage. It could use this coverage information to determine if some code that has been modified, should trigger re-running a specific test.\r\n\r\nMost other test runners already do this, and it is super useful. For instance, Live Unit Testing in Visual Studio Professional, Jest does it within JavaScript, Ava seems to do it, and ReSharper\u0027s DotCover does it as well.\r\n\r\nRight now, I have to run my whole test suite every time I change a few things. That\u0027s a huge time consumer! It forces me to use Visual Studio instead of Visual Studio Code for now, and I\u0027d love to make the switch.\r\n\r\n*I think it is important that coverage files are still supported. That way, Visual Studio Code extensions like Coverage Gutters still works well in watch mode.*\r\n\r\n# Flow\r\nTo explain this with an example, I\u0027ll describe it as a flow of steps.\r\n\r\n## 1. I make a class and a test\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class SomeClass {\r\n   public bool SomeCondition {get;set;}\r\n\r\n   public A() {\r\n      if(SomeCondition) {\r\n         Console.WriteLine(\"A1\");\r\n      } else {\r\n         Console.WriteLine(\"A2\");\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[TestClass]\r\npublic class SomeClassTest {\r\n   [TestMethod]\r\n   public void TestA1() {\r\n      var obj = new SomeClass() { SomeCondition = true };\r\n      obj.A();\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   [TestMethod]\r\n   public void TestA2() {\r\n      var obj = new SomeClass() { SomeCondition = false };\r\n      obj.A();\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. I run the tests in watch mode\r\nThe test runner now internally keeps track of the coverage. In other words, half of method `A` is now covered by `TestA1`, and half by `TestA2`.\r\n\r\n## 3. I modify some of the code\r\nI modify the original class to be the following (changing the `Console.WriteLine(\"A1\")` to `Console.WriteLine(\"foo\")`:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class SomeClass {\r\n   public bool SomeCondition {get;set;}\r\n\r\n   public A() {\r\n      if(SomeCondition) {\r\n         Console.WriteLine(\"foo\"); //this line was changed\r\n      } else {\r\n         Console.WriteLine(\"A2\");\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. The test runner runs affected tests\r\nNow, the test runner detects that only covered paths by the test `TestA1` has been changed, so it only runs the `TestA1` test.",

This is because the browser launch depends on reading the standard output from the underlying `Process` (as you discovered @rabberbock).\r\n\r\nWhen the process is started if it has any handler attached to `OnOutput` it must set `RedirectStandardOutput` to `true`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/cd5303d6d82b067ec5365970229fe34588f924d0/src/Tools/dotnet-watch/src/Internal/ProcessRunner.cs#L102\r\n\r\nWhen this happens we lose our colors.  The `DataReceivedEventHandler.Data` property only contains text with no color info.  At the same time, we can\u0027t just \"look\" at the output and still have it appear as it normally would in the console.\r\n\r\n**What to do?**\r\n\r\nGiven the way this works right now, we _cannot_ have colors and launch the browser (unless there\u0027s a way to stop redirecting output when the process has already started, which I didn\u0027t find).  \r\n\r\nThe downside is that we also lose the excellent auto-refresh feature, which as far as I can tell could run completely separately from the browser launching.  So my proposal for a fix is to simply decouple the two and allow the refresh server to launch without also needing the browser to launch.\r\n\r\nI am submitting a simple PR that just moves the refresh server code out of the `if` statement that launches the browser.",

        "body":  "One of the more tedious tasks in building any app is of course the endless cycle of tinkering for the correct shade of grey for that input border. Scoped CSS is really, really great! But after extensively using `dotnet watch run ` for building a Blazor WebAssembly app, let\u0027s just say we have had ample time to think of some improvements in the development inner loop in this area :-). \r\n\r\n1. Make \u0027dotnet watch run\u0027 smarter for the type of file that is changed. For CSS file change, only a few tasks need to run, not the full build pipeline. Furthermore, only the touched scoped css files could be diffed into the generated CSS file, without gobbling / touching the other files.\r\n2. Scoped CSS file is just a file, it doesn\u0027t need a full host restart. Just set the correct headers to force reload of that file and trigger refresh, but not a restart of the whole host. \r\n3. A huge, huge time saver would be the possibility to directly edit scoped CSS files the browser DEV tools back to razor.css file using a map file like TypeScript files via the Filesystem in the Sources tab.\r\n\r\nSee also: [https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27270](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27270)\r\n\r\n",

Meanwhile I finally figured out how to get Hot Module Replacement working right.\r\n\r\nDuring development I have running:\r\n\r\n- Dart Sass watch for converting component\u0027s SCSS files to CSS\r\n- ```dotnet watch msbuild``` for generating the scoped CSS and the .Net DLLs\r\n- Wevpack dev server with HMR enabled. It compiles Typescript and bundles scoped CSS along with global CSS\r\n\r\nOn the browser I keep opened the Webpack dev server proxied page and whenever I touch a CSS, it is compiled by SASS, then by msbuild and finally Webpack loads it on the browser without reloading the page. It takes less than a second from modifying CSS to get results on the browser.\r\n\r\nTo keep the app running I use the usual VSCode launch task without the pre-dependency on the build step, because the project i s already builded due to the dotnet watch. I think that with VS2019 should be almost the same. Also I\u0027ve set VSCode to not open browser on launch, because the whole thing is about keeping the browser always opened and up to date.\r\n\r\nAlso I\u0027ve set on ```Program.cs``` a code to touch a file on the ```wwwroot``` folder whenever the app is restarted. This way the Webpack dev server reloads the browser when I change the .Net code.\r\n\r\nThe final result is the same as working with ```dotnet watch run``` but with CSS HMR added for all CSS editin. But for working with .Net code you use the normal edit-F5-test cycle. If you use a normal ```dotnet watch run``` for .Net code, the app is restarted also on CSS editing, losing the HMR capabilities. Of course, you can use a normal ```dotnet watch run``` if you are not going to touch the CSS files.\r\n\r\n",

Sorry for the delay, I\u0027ve been busy.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve come to a setup that integrates Webpack bundling and HMR into the development process using MSBuild:\r\n\r\n- It supports scoped SCSS: ```Component1.razor.scss``` is scoped by Blazor and bundled with Webpack.\r\n- It supports global component SCSS: ```Component1.razor.global.scss``` is detected and included in the global CSS without the \u0027scoping\u0027 that Blazor do. It\u0027s for third party JS component integration. For example, we have a Blazor component that is based on Select2, which needs some \u0027not scoped\u0027 CSS. We don\u0027t want to put this CSS into a separate global file, so we have it on the ```.razor.global.scss``` next to the ```.razor```\r\n- It supports scoped Typescript: ```Component1.razor.ts```. It\u0027s compiled and bundled and loaded into the page. As it\u0027s bundled by Webpack, you can\u0027t use standard JS ```import``` so [Javascript Isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-5.0#blazor-javascript-isolation-and-object-references) won\u0027t work. By using Webpack you can easily integrate third party libs with npm and get it all bundled from ```node_module```. But you have to come with your custom module management to prevent global namespace pollution. It\u0027s relatively easy.\r\n- It supports Webpack HMR for CSS development. We\u0027ve created two ```package.json``` scripts for this:\r\n    - ```npm run watch-only-css-hmr``` launches Webpack HMR server on watch mode and ```dotnet watch build``` restricted to only scoping CSS. So you have a \u0027watch\u0027 over CSS. Then you can launch the full Blazor project (```dotnet run``` or simply ```F5```) and start editing SCSS.\r\n    - ```npm run wath-run-all``` does the same but also launchs a full ```dotnet watch run``` for the C# and Typescript code, so when you modify code, the project is compiled and reloaded, but when you modify SCSS, only HMR is triggered.\r\n\r\nFor reference I\u0027ve created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/Peluko/5abab40afd56fd01f7e9b93654082550) with the relevant files. The comments on the files are in Spanish. If you don\u0027t understand something, don\u0027t hesitate to ask.\r\n \r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n",

Depending on the shell, different symbols are escaped. In PowerShell, \"woohoo i got $$!\" will replace `$$` with some token based on context. Bash has its own issues, apparently: https://github.com/aspnet/UserSecrets/issues/76 . And Windows Terminal behaves differently from cmd.exe. All in all, there\u0027s far too much room for error, especially when entering things like passwords.\r\n\r\n2. Many shells and terminals log all inputs as a convenience feature, which could lead to accidental exposure of secrets.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nAn interaction like this would be nice:\r\n```\r\n\u003e dotnet user-secrets set\r\nEnter secret name: test\r\nEnter secret value:\r\nSuccessfully saved test = \u003c25 characters\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, entering `dotnet user-secrets set \"test\"` prompts for the value.\r\n\r\nIn either case, I think a warning to encourage users to enter values this way would also be helpful.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you\u0027ve considered\r\nWriting directly to the to `secrets.json`, aside from being cumbersome, suffers a similar problem as *1*, as the user would need to be aware of JavaScript\u0027s escape sequences.",

When a tool attempts to decode the event, or an`EventListener` dispatches the event, it will treat the event as if it has two enums as payloads, even though the data payload does not match.  The way to fix this is to make sure that the arguments to `WriteEvent` match the arguments to the event method itself.\r\n\r\nAnother example is `CreateDevelopmentCertificateEnd` (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Shared/CertificateGeneration/CertificateManager.cs#L861), which takes no arguments, but passes a string to `WriteEvent`.  In cases like this, the event name should describe the context around when the event is logged, which I believe it does.  The string that gets passed to `WriteEvent` will not be seen by an event consumer, but is allocated and logged into the file.\r\n\r\nIn general, any usage of string constants or string interpolation inside of an event method is incorrect.  Context should either come from the event name itself or from the arguments, but don\u0027t feel required to make the strings \"super clean\" - it\u0027s more important to make the logging paths as low cost as possible.",

One solution could be add the capability to include a target to be executed before the reload happens\r\n\r\n```csproj\r\n\u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n  \u003cstyles Include=\"styles.css\" /\u003e\r\n  \u003cWatch Include=\"@(styles)\"  WatchAction=\"BrowserRefresh\" ExecuteTargetBefore=\"SomeTargetThatHandlesReload\"/\u003e\r\n\u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Provides a way to include our own `FileHandler` to `HotReload.cs`: \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic HotReload(ProcessRunner processRunner, IReporter reporter)\r\n{\r\n    _staticFileHandler = new StaticFileHandler(reporter);\r\n    _scopedCssFileHandler = new ScopedCssFileHandler(processRunner, reporter);\r\n    _compilationHandler = new CompilationHandler(reporter);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nThe motivation for this is to give the chance to provide a unified experience when working on projects that integrate other tools like `nodejs postcss`.\r\n\r\nFor example this: \r\n\r\n```csproj\r\n\u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n  \u003cstyles Include=\"styles.css\" /\u003e\r\n\u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n```\r\nis taken by a custom target that replaces `tailwind directives` on it and emits the result on `/bin/debug/net6.0/wwwroot`, I know this can be done by emitting the file directly on the project\u0027s `wwwroot` but having compiled files on it does not look elegant at all plus creates common confusions to new developers like \"should I include this on source control?\".\r\n\r\n\r\n🌟 Thanks for taking the time to read through.\r\n",

If you switch multitargeting to single target, hot reload will start working.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n* ASP.NET Core version 6.0.0-preview.3.21201.13\r\n* dotnet --info \r\n```log\r\n.NET SDK

Given a task that is generating a number of files, one might tend to want to delete all the files in the output folder before re-building cleanly. If these deleted files are part of the dotnet watch list, watch will no longer live reload the page if any of these files change and have the same name. \r\n\r\nHigh level example:\r\n- I have a gulp.watch task that has a binding to execute when the project opens / is built.\r\n- My watch task will first delete \"wwwroot/someFolder\", then rebuild all files and output them back into \"wwwroot/someFolder\". Think assets or CSS files or anything really.\r\n- dotnet watch will no longer track any changes **unless** I comment out the delete parts of my task.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nIt seems like dotnet watch is tracking/caching a pointer to a specific \"wwwroot/css/styles.css\" for example, and if that file gets deleted and re-created I would like to see the page refresh. \r\n\r\nIn other words, if your implementation is going to default to include watching \"wwwroot\\**\" then it shouldn\u0027t matter what happens in there, any change to the filesystem and you should refresh.\r\n\r\nFor now I will remove the deletion part of the watch task and leave it solely to a initial Build or Dist build gulp task.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nIt matters not if my glob target is \"wwwroot/someFolder\" or \"wwwroot/someFolder/**/*\" on the deletion path, as soon as it wipes the files, watch doesn\u0027t reload.\r\n\r\nI have not logged this as a bug as I don\u0027t know if it is in fact something wrong on my implementation, or a default behavior on your end. Further, I wouldn\u0027t believe that everyone wants this necessarily, however they do have the Exclude option.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.",

See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36526\r\n\r\nWhen `PublishTrimmed` isn\u0027t set, the \"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Watch.BrowserRefresh\" assembly is already loaded in the process by the time the following code is invoked:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/545d4eece7fcc5a67b27f6ba96636d9f476741ae/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/GenericHost/GenericWebHostBuilder.cs#L139-L145\r\n\r\nSo loading the assembly works, because it is already loaded.\r\n\r\nWhen `PublishTrimmed=true` is set, Startup Hooks are disabled, which means the assembly isn\u0027t already loaded. And trying to load the assembly fails with \"FileNotFoundException\".\r\n\r\n\u003e  I\u0027m guessing hosting startups will fail when trimmed but I\u0027m surprised this affects the developer experience.\r\n\r\nThis is an intentional decision with `PublishTrimmed`. The intention is that `dotnet run` and `dotnet publish` apps should execute the exact same. Since Startup Hooks can\u0027t work with trimmed apps, we disable the feature by default when trimming. There are a number of other features that are disabled by default, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/c3850ddbd2c92702cf62868d0614d35a1278f7bb/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.ILLink.targets#L31-L47\r\n\r\nWe recommend app devs set `PublishTrimmed=true` in their apps if they intend on trimming - see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trim-self-contained#trim-your-app---cli. This gives the most consistent behavior between F5/run and publish.\r\n\r\nThe ASP.NET SDK (or `dotnet watch`) can re-enable `StartupHookSupport` in MSBuild if it requires Startup Hooks to work at development time.

So the assumptions:\r\n- Hot-Reload will only be applied to non-trimmed application code (this doesn\u0027t mean that the app is not enabled for trimming, nor that it won\u0027t eventually be published as trimmed, just that the build of the app to which we apply hot-reload has not been trimmed).\r\n- Our tooling fully controls the spawning of the application to be \"hot-reloaded\". Meaning our code creates the process which starts the app (and prepares it for hot-reload). Another way - we don\u0027t support \"attaching hot-reload\"\r\n\r\nIf this is true then I think we can make this work reasonably well:\r\n* We need to make sure the app is not trimmed, and fail otherwise. This would probably mean some SDK solution. Note that we want to keep `PublishTrimmed` untouched as it governs analysis as well. We just need to make sure that trimmer doesn\u0027t run. For console/ASP.NET apps this is already the case for `dotnet build` (since trimming only happens during `dotnet publish`), but other app models may run trimmer during build - for those it would have to be disabled.\r\n  * Side note: This is probably already necessary as I can\u0027t see how hot-reload would actually work with trimming. The runtime would not see the same picture as the compiler...\r\n* On non-trimmed app, startup hooks will always work, they just have to be enabled. This means that we need to modify the `.runtimeconfig.json` of the app we\u0027re starting to set `System.StartupHookProvider.IsSupported` runtime property to `true` (or not set it at all). The best way to achieve this would be in SDK as well, but it would mean that we know that we\u0027re building for hot-reload. This can be done after the fact by editing the `.runtimeconfig.json`, but that\u0027s a bit \"hacky\".\r\n* Since we control the start of the process we fully control the `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` environment variable. So we overwrite anything in it with just our hot-reload startup hook and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWith these there should be no observable behavioral difference between Debug/Hot-Reload/Release/Published app - even if the app has `PublishTrimmed=true` which will by default disable startup hooks in all configurations (and in hot-reload we would enable them), they would effectively not work since the env. variable which controls them would be overwritten.\r\n\r\nMain downside is that this is rather fragile: Ideally we would produce slightly different build of the app for hot-reload (different runtime-config).\r\n\r\nAlternative solutions (requires changed to runtime/framework):\r\n* We could introduce a new way to trigger the hot-reload code in the app (not startup hook), something built specifically for hot-reload.\r\n* Slightly less invasive change would be to introduce an environment variable to enable startup hooks even if they\u0027re disabled in the runtime config. Note that this would not be a new thing, we already have other feature switches (globalization for example) which are controlled both by runtime property and env. variable. This would mean that normal setup for startup hooks would still be \"disabled\", but hot-reload could enable it by simply setting a new env. variable, but still use the same startup hook mechanisms as everything else. (the env. variable would have no effect on trimmed apps, those would have startup hooks disabled always).",

I believe having a variable set in all builds started by `dotnet-watch` can be a good extensibility point.  \r\n\r\n😊 Thanks for your time.",

        "body":  "**dotnet version**: 5.0.400\r\n\r\n**issue**: I\u0027m trying to use `dotnet watch test` to run unit tests whenever I modify a file in my csproj, including certain json files. I have two projects: Core.SDK.csproj and Core.SDK.Tests.csproj. The JSON files exist in Core.SDK.csproj, so I would like the unit test to run if those json files are modified. I run `dotnet watch -p Core.SDK.Tests.csproj test` and tests are run when .cs files are modified, but not the json files.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\u003c!-- CoreSDK.csproj, in brief --\u003e\r\n  \u003cPropertyGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cTargetFramework\u003enetstandard2.1\u003c/TargetFramework\u003e\r\n  \u003c/PropertyGroup\u003e\r\n\r\n  \u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cContent Include=\"Manifest/manifest-schema.json\" CopyToOutputDirectory=\"Always\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003cContent Include=\"Manifest/BuiltIn/*.json\" CopyToOutputDirectory=\"Always\" /\u003e\r\n  \u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n\r\n  \u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003c!-- extends watching group to include *manifest.json files --\u003e\r\n    \u003cWatch Include=\"**/*.manifest.json\" /\u003e\r\n  \u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\u003c!-- CoreSDK.Tests.csproj, in brief --\u003e\r\n  \u003cPropertyGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cTargetFramework\u003enet5.0\u003c/TargetFramework\u003e\r\n  \u003c/PropertyGroup\u003e\r\n\r\n  \u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cProjectReference Include=\"..\\SDK.Core\\SDK.Core.csproj\" /\u003e\r\n  \u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n**my investigation**: I ran `dotnet watch -p \u003cproj\u003e --list` to see the exact files that dotnet watch is looking. For the CoreSDK project, everything looks as expected.\r\n```\r\ndotnet watch -p .\\SDK.Core --list\r\n...\r\n.\\platform\\SDK.Core\\bin\\Debug\\netstandard2.1\\Manifest\\BuiltIn\\standard.manifest.json\r\n.\\platform\\SDK.Core\\Manifest\\BuiltIn\\standard.manifest.json\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the CoreSDK.Tests project, I see an issue, the files show as existing under the \"SDK.Core.Tests\" directory!\r\n```\r\ndotnet watch -p .\\SDK.Core.Tests\\ --list\r\n...\r\n.\\platform\\SDK.Core.Tests\\bin\\Debug\\netstandard2.1\\Manifest\\BuiltIn\\standard.manifest.json\r\n.\\platform\\SDK.Core.Tests\\Manifest\\BuiltIn\\standard.manifest.json\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**conclusion**: Based on this output, dotnet watch thinks that `standard.manifest.json` should exist in directory of the test project. This path that it spit out does not exist, so it never sees a change in the file, and hence doesn\u0027t run tests when the actual json file from the CoreSDK project changes.\r\n",

We\u0027ll help you! --\u003e\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI have a solution consisting of 3 projects:\r\n* Secret.Api (Asp.NET webapi running on https://localhost:5001)\r\n* Secret.Shared (classlib)\r\n* Secret.WebApp (blazorwasm hosted by Secret.Api)\r\nI develop running `dotnet watch run` running in a terminal next to my editor.\r\nSometimes when I change files (does not matter of which project), the dotnet watch process hangs up.\r\nThe last output often looks something like this:\r\n```\r\nwatch : Files changed: /path/to/repo/Secret/Secret.Api/SomeThing/SomeClass.cs, /path/to/repo/Secret.Api/Something/4913\r\n```\r\nThe second file with the 4 digit numeric filename is only displayed when I use Vim I think, but the hangup happens independently of the editor. I think its filename is always 4913 and it apparently comes from the same directory as the file that got changed.\r\nWhen I hit Ctrl-C, this gets printed:\r\n```\r\nUnhandled exception. System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException: A task was canceled.\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools.BlazorWebAssemblyDeltaApplier.\u003c\u003ec__DisplayClass6_0.\u003c\u003cGetApplyUpdateCapabilitiesAsync\u003eg__GetApplyUpdateCapabilitiesCoreAsync|0\u003ed.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools.BlazorWebAssemblyHostedDeltaApplier.GetApplyUpdateCapabilitiesAsync(DotNetWatchContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools.CompilationWorkspaceProvider.CreateProject(TaskCompletionSource`1 taskCompletionSource, Task`1 hotReloadCapabilitiesTask, String projectPath, IReporter reporter, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at System.Threading.Tasks.Task.\u003c\u003ec.\u003cThrowAsync\u003eb__127_1(Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.QueueUserWorkItemCallbackDefaultContext.Execute()\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadPoolWorkQueue.Dispatch()\r\n   at System.Threading.PortableThreadPool.WorkerThread.WorkerThreadStart()\r\n   at System.Threading.Thread.StartCallback()\r\n```\r\nTyping \"reset\" (while no characters are appearing in the console) fixes the broken terminal problem, but it happens quite frequently. Sometimes it happens many times in a row, and at other times I can make ~5 changes without it hanging up.\r\n\u003c!--\r\n* Please share a clear and concise description of the problem.\r\n* Include minimal steps to reproduce the problem if possible. E.g.: the smallest possible code snippet; or a small repo to clone, with steps to run it.\r\n* What behavior are you seeing, and what behavior would you expect?\r\n  --\u003e\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\ndotnet 6.0.100-rc.1.21463.6\r\nTested with Linux Mint 20.2, Debian 12 (bookworm, testing), Windows 10, MacBook pro 2017 using Vim, VS Code, VS 2022 Preview\r\nAll are x64\r\nSince this is a blazor project: This happens independently of the browser (Firefox or Chromium).\r\n\u003c!--\r\n* Which version of .NET is the code running on?\r\n* What OS and version, and for Linux, what distro?\r\n* What is the architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64)?\r\n* Do you know whether it is specific to that configuration?\r\n* If you\u0027re using Blazor, which web browser(s) do you see this issue in?\r\n  --\u003e\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nSince dotnet 5 did not have hot-reload capabilities, these problems did not exist back when we were using dotnet 5.\r\nWhen I create a new blazorwasm project using `dotnet new blazorwasm -o TestProject` hot reloading and everything works as expected.\r\nI have rewritten `Properties/launchSettings.json`, copied it over from a freshly created blazor WASM project because my only guess was the problems originated from there.\r\nAlso I tried to set hotReloadProfile in launchSettings.json to any possible value I could find in the web, used the profile explicitly with `dotnet watch run --profile ...`, but none of that had an effect.\r\n\u003c!--\r\n* Did this work in a previous build or release of .NET Core, or from .NET Framework? If you can try a previous release or build to find out, that can help us narrow down the problem. If you don\u0027t know, that\u0027s OK.\r\n  --\u003e\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\nWhen `dotnet watch run` detects a change and rebuilds the backend, the blazor WASM application does not reload at all.\r\nThe blazor error UI appears at the bottom of the page and this exception gets printed to the browser console:\r\n```\r\nError: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.HotReload.WebAssemblyHotReload.ApplyHotReloadDelta(String moduleIdString, Byte[] metadataDelta, Byte[] ilDeta)\r\n   at System.Reflection.RuntimeMethodInfo.Invoke(Object obj, BindingFlags invokeAttr, Binder binder, Object[] parameters, CultureInfo culture)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n   at Microsoft.JSInterop.Infrastructure.DotNetDispatcher.InvokeSynchronously(JSRuntime jsRuntime, DotNetInvocationInfo\u0026 callInfo, IDotNetObjectReference objectReference, String argsJson)\r\n   at Microsoft.JSInterop.Infrastructure.DotNetDispatcher.Invoke(JSRuntime jsRuntime, DotNetInvocationInfo\u0026 invocationInfo, String argsJson)\r\n   at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Services.DefaultWebAssemblyJSRuntime.InvokeDotNet(String assemblyName, String methodIdentifier, String dotNetObjectId, String argsJson)\r\n    _convert_exception_for_method_call https://localhost:5001/_framework/dotnet.6.0.0-rc.1.21451.13.js:1\r\n    _handle_exception_for_call https://localhost:5001/_framework/dotnet.6.0.0-rc.1.21451.13.js:1\r\n    managed__Microsoft_AspNetCore_Components_WebAssembly__Microsoft_AspNetCore_Components_WebAssembly_Services_DefaultWebAssemblyJSRuntime_InvokeDotNet https://mono-wasm.invalid/managed__Microsoft_AspNetCore_Components_WebAssembly__Microsoft_AspNetCore_Components_WebAssembly_Services_DefaultWebAssemblyJSRuntime_InvokeDotNet:20\r\n    invokeDotNetFromJS https://localhost:5001/_framework/blazor.webassembly.js:1\r\n    g https://localhost:5001/_framework/blazor.webassembly.js:1\r\n    invokeMethod https://localhost:5001/_framework/blazor.webassembly.js:1\r\n    applyHotReload https://localhost:5001/_framework/blazor.webassembly.js:1\r\n    applyBlazorDeltas https://localhost:5001/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js:122\r\n    applyBlazorDeltas https://localhost:5001/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js:120\r\n    BlazorHotReloadDeltav1 https://localhost:5001/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js:38\r\n    onmessage\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\n* Please include any relevant stack traces or error messages.

I stumbled upon the dotnet watch tutorial page for .net 6: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/dotnet-watch?view=aspnetcore-6.0\r\nAt the very bottom is a section talking about browser refresh and dotnet watch injecting a .js script (which I ended up putting into index.html) and this got hot reload working via dotnet watch for me, it however did not fix hot reload working in VS 2022 directly so my workaround atm is to explicitly use dotnet watch via the debug profile by using the SwitchStartupProject VS extension.\r\n\r\nThe script section they refer to that worked for me was this:\r\n```\r\n@* _Layout.cshtml -or- index.html *@\r\n\u003cenvironment names=\"Development\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\u003c/environment\u003e\r\n```\r\nAnd call dotnet watch in the launchsettings.json (w/o run, adding run seems to break hot reload again by thinking no files are actually changed for whatever reason):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": {\r\n    \"Peiskos.Server\": {\r\n      \"commandName\": \"Executable\",\r\n      \"executablePath\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\dotnet\\\\dotnet.exe\",\r\n      \"commandLineArgs\": \"watch\",\r\n      \"workingDirectory\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Rick\\\\source\\\\repos\\\\rwobig93\\\\Peiskos\\\\src\\\\Server\",\r\n      \"launchUrl\": \"https://localhost:5001\",\r\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\r\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"inspectUri\": \"{wsProtocol}://{url.hostname}:{url.port}/_framework/debug/ws-proxy?browser={browserInspectUri}\",\r\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000\",\r\n      \"dotnetRunMessages\": \"true\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",

        "body":  "### Describe the bug\r\nHot reloading scoped css works for Blazor Server and should also work for Blazor within WebView2 with `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.Wpf` package.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u0027t.\r\n\r\nCuriously, hot reloading DOM changes like editing the text of an h1 element works as expected.\r\n\r\nAs shown below, `dotnet watch` does somewhat work for css (with manual/hacky workarounds).\r\nVS 2022 Hot Reload does not update the generated bundle css file and therefore does not work at all.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the announcement post for _**WPF**_:\r\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-3/#blazorwebview-controls-for-wpf-windows-forms\r\n2. Update NuGet packages to latest .NET 6 versions\r\n3. Add an isolated css file `Counter.razor.css` and a style like\r\n```css\r\nh1 { color: red; }\r\n```\r\n4. Run `dotnet watch --verbose` in the command line in the project-directory\r\n5. Change the color in the css file to `blue`\r\n6. `dotnet watch` outputs updated file but it\u0027s **_not_ reflected** in-app\r\n7. Click somewhere in the app and press \u003ckbd\u003eCTRL+R\u003c/kbd\u003e to reload the page\r\n8. See the updated style reflected in the app\r\n\r\n### Workaround 1 (With dotnet watch)\r\nClick somewhere in the app window and press \u003ckbd\u003eCTRL+R\u003c/kbd\u003e\r\n\r\n### Workaround 2 (With dotnet watch)\r\nForce reloading of css with timer in JS in `index.html` (for a project named `WpfApp1`):\r\n```html\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chead\u003e\r\n

Instead of the value stored in `secrets.json` `null` is returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new \"ASP.NET Core Web API\" project.\r\n2. In the newly created project directory execute the command `dotnet user-secrets init`.\r\n3. Add a new user secret by executing the command `dotnet user-secrets set \"Key\" \"12345\"`.\r\n4. In the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup.cs` file add `string key = Configuration[\"Key\"];` as the first line of the method.\r\n5. Set a break point to the second line of the above mentioned method and build and start the program with the attached debugger. The `key` variable contains the value 12345.\r\n6. Edit the .csproj file of the project and add the MSBuild property `\u003cGenerateAssemblyInfo\u003efalse\u003c/GenerateAssemblyInfo\u003e` to the existing `ProjectGroup`.\r\n7. Compile and start the program again. The `key` variable will now contain `null` instead of 12345.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nAdd an `AssemblyInfo.cs` file to the project and add `[assembly: UserSecretsId(\"GUID\")]` where `GUID` is the same GUID that is stored in the `UserSecretsId` property of the `.csproj` file.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `key` variable should still contain 12345, not `null` without being forced to add the `UserSecretsId` to the `AssemblyInfo.cs` file.\r\n\r\n## User Impact\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve wasted several hours to figure out how to make user secrets work. There is no obvious connection between setting `GenerateAssemblyInfo` to `false` and not being able to read user secrets anymore which means that users will not figure out easily what the problem is even when doing online searches.\r\n\r\nThere is little justification for being forced to add the `UserSecretsId` attribute to the `AssemblyInfo.cs` file if it is already present in the .csproj file.\r\n",

I don\u0027t even know what those things do.\r\n\r\nI think we have two pieces:\r\n\r\n* Browser Refresh for static content and Razor Content\r\n* Hot Reload for .NET code changes including Razor\r\n  * for Razor code this also handles RazorRuntimeCompilation \r\n\r\n### Confusing Configuration and Terminology\r\nThe way this is today it feels confusing because the docs and Visual studio configuration talk about Hot Reload, but don\u0027t mention the browser refresh. Visual Studio then also BrowserLink (which has nothing to do with any of this) along with config options that are prominent in the server UI. Is anybody still using that for Core projects? With all of this there doesn\u0027t appear to be a way to turn off the browser refresh in `dotnet watch` or even in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n### Startup Banner\r\nCurrently the banner shows the `--no-hot-reload` flag, which works to turn off hot reload, but **does not disable browser refresh** (or whatever that\u0027s called) - apps still refresh the browser on static files. I think the banner may also be confusing if you have more in it than we do now. I think the limit there is a single option or it\u0027s too much (see below). Much more important IMHO is command line switches that obviously control the two settings above or a single switch that disables them both (see below).\r\n\r\n### Command Line Switches\r\nAt minimum I would expect another command line switch like `--no-browser-refresh` to disable the browser refresh. Even better I think there should be some flag that disables all hot-reload and browser refresh and basically uses the old `dotnet watch` behavior that simply recompiles and restarts server code. Not sure what to call it.  `--server-only` perhaps?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best approach would be to put the `dotnet watch --help` link into the banner (because not so obvious to newbies) and then have more detail there including the doc link.\r\n\r\n### Current Default Behavior is Fine\r\nAs I mentioned in various threads I had lots of issues during previews, but the Browser Refresh and Hot Reload functionality works great with the final RTM bits of ASP.NET 6.0.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is great for the default behavior - 90% of the time you\u0027d want all of this stuff working so all of these are non-default options to apply. But there are scenarios where auto browser refresh gets in the way - complex forms with user entered data, some auth themes, client side or server apps that have their own browser refresh already running (that\u0027s my use case for a number of server projects).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other stuff\r\nAs I\u0027ve built and maintained a live reload component for some time now I\u0027ve run into a lot of edge case requests from users over the years. A common theme is that quite a few people need to include and exclude folders and files and extensions from being checked. This might be something useful to add although probably beyond the scope of this generic utility.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It had an extra space at the end of the body tag.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\n\u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003chead\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003ctitle\u003eEmptyBlazor6App\u003c/title\u003e\r\n    \u003cbase href=\"/\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003clink href=\"css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003clink href=\"css/app.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003clink href=\"EmptyBlazor6App.Client.styles.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /\u003e\r\n\u003c/head\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cbody\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv id=\"app\"\u003eLoading...\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n    \u003cdiv id=\"blazor-error-ui\"\u003e\r\n        An unhandled error has occurred.\r\n        \u003ca href=\"\" class=\"reload\"\u003eReload\u003c/a\u003e\r\n        \u003ca class=\"dismiss\"\u003e🗙\u003c/a\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003cscript src=\"_framework/blazor.webassembly.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n\u003c/body \u003e \u003c!--THE ISSUE IS RIGHT HERE--\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n`\u003c/body \u003e`\r\nShould have been:\r\n`\u003c/body\u003e`\r\n\r\nThis is more hopefully just an FYI as opposed to something that perhaps a direct bug. \r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Blazor WebAssembly project\r\n2. Incorrectly configure your body tag on your index.html to have an extra space at the end.\r\n3. Witness hot reload not work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- .NET version: 6.0\r\n- using dotnet watch\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixes/Workarounds\r\nMake sure the \u003cbody\u003e tags don\u0027t have any extra space in them so that the Hot Reload Deltas can be correctly applied.",

        "body":  "### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nWhen using `dotnet watch` the file polling throws following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwatch : Polling file watcher is enabled\r\nwatch : Started\r\nUnhandled exception. System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: /src/Startup.cs\r\n   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.TryInsert(TKey key, TValue value, InsertionBehavior behavior)\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Internal.PollingFileWatcher.\u003cCheckForChangedFiles\u003eb__23_0(FileSystemInfo f)\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Internal.PollingFileWatcher.ForeachEntityInDirectory(DirectoryInfo dirInfo, Action`1 fileAction)\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Internal.PollingFileWatcher.CheckForChangedFiles()\r\n   at Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Internal.PollingFileWatcher.PollingLoop()\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context(Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location ---\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet new web -f net5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd [Directory.Build.props](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/Directory.Build.props) to move `bin` and `obj`. The bug is however reproducible without this.\r\n\r\nMake sure bin and obj are empty.\r\n\r\n(on Windows)\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run --rm -it -p 5000:80 -v ${pwd}:/src -w /src -e ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:80 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 dotnet watch run --no-launch-profile\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nThis only happens when the project hasn\u0027t been built yet. If I start the container with just `dotnet run` once, shut down the container, and then change back to `dotnet watch run` as entrypoint, it works.\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible with .NET 6 too.\r\n\r\n### Output of `docker version`\r\n\r\n20.10.10, build b485636\r\n\r\n### Output of `docker info`\r\n```\r\nClient:\r\n Context:    default\r\n Debug Mode: false\r\n Plugins:\r\n  buildx: Build with BuildKit (Docker Inc., v0.6.3)\r\n  compose: Docker Compose (Docker Inc., v2.1.1)\r\n  scan: Docker Scan (Docker Inc., 0.9.0)\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n Containers: 3\r\n  Running: 0\r\n  Paused: 0\r\n  Stopped: 3\r\n Images: 15\r\n Server Version: 20.10.10\r\n Storage Driver: overlay2\r\n  Backing Filesystem: extfs\r\n  Supports d_type: true\r\n  Native Overlay Diff: true\r\n  userxattr: false\r\n Logging Driver: json-file\r\n Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs\r\n Cgroup Version: 1\r\n Plugins:\r\n  Volume: local\r\n  Network: bridge host ipvlan macvlan null overlay\r\n  Log: awslogs fluentd gcplogs gelf journald json-file local logentries splunk syslog\r\n Swarm: inactive\r\n Runtimes: io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux runc io.containerd.runc.v2\r\n Default Runtime: runc\r\n Init Binary: docker-init\r\n containerd version: 5b46e404f6b9f661a205e28d59c982d3634148f8\r\n runc version: v1.0.2-0-g52b36a2\r\n init version: de40ad0\r\n Security Options:\r\n  seccomp\r\n   Profile: default\r\n Kernel Version: 5.10.60.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2\r\n Operating System: Docker Desktop\r\n OSType: linux\r\n Architecture: x86_64\r\n CPUs: 8\r\n Total Memory: 12.42GiB\r\n Name: docker-desktop\r\n ID: IJEP:3W6Y:PWQF:KZOW:UBLU:PCJG:WOQ4:P2NB:B2ZP:TPMR:4PTD:BERP\r\n Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker\r\n Debug Mode: false\r\n Registry: https://index.docker.io/v1/\r\n Labels:\r\n Experimental: false\r\n Insecure Registries:\r\n  127.0.0.0/8\r\n Live Restore Enabled: false\r\n```",

Because it\u0027s not immediately obvious that this is a bug in our framework, we would like to keep this around to collect more feedback, which can later help us determine the impact of it. We will re-evaluate this issue, during our next planning meeting(s). \nIf we later determine, that the issue has no community involvement, or it\u0027s very rare and low-impact issue, we will close it - so that the team can focus on more important and high impact issues.\nTo learn more about what to expect next and how this issue will be handled you can read more about our triage process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/TriageProcess.md).",

If it definitely should then please make it bolded in the documentation.\r\nDevelopers are often customizing these names, e.g. _Local_ for the local development machine which breaks the functionality.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nChange ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT in the project\u0027s launchSettings.json from Development to anything else.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n`Error: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.`\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.100\n\n### Anything else?\n\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   6.0.100\r\n Commit:    9e8b04bbff\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19044\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 6.0.1\r\n  Commit:  3a25a7f1cc\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.416 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.22 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.22 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.22 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.13 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]",

Because it\u0027s not immediately obvious that this is a bug in our framework, we would like to keep this around to collect more feedback, which can later help us determine the impact of it. We will re-evaluate this issue, during our next planning meeting(s). \nIf we later determine, that the issue has no community involvement, or it\u0027s very rare and low-impact issue, we will close it - so that the team can focus on more important and high impact issues.\nTo learn more about what to expect next and how this issue will be handled you can read more about our triage process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/TriageProcess.md).",

Currently when I use dotnet watch a websocket connection is created for browser refresh, but the port is randomly assigned. Because of this I can\u0027t set the port in my dockerfile and thus can\u0027t use auto refresh in browser.\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\nA way to set the ports for browser refresh. Perhaps in the launch settings as an optional setting. And still assign a random port if no preference is provided.",

Note that dynamic default values cannot be set via the CLI, this is just about how they\u0027re displayed to indicate their default value is currently set from a dynamic source:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--name        [Environment.UserName]\r\n--not-before  [DateTime.UtcNow]\r\n--audience    [ApplicationUrl]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Multi-value options defaults\r\n\r\nSome options support specifying multiple values at JWT creation time, e.g. `--claim`, `--scope`, `--role`, `--audience`. These options can have multiple defaults configured with those defaults being applied to all JWTs created. A single default value can be removed for such options by using the `--remove` option:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --scope myapps:user --scope myapps:read\r\nDefault value of myapps:user for --scope added \r\nDefault value of myapps:read for --scope added \r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --scope myapps:read --remove\r\nDefault value of myapps:read for --scope removed\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Global vs. project defaults\r\n\r\n\u003e❓ Do we think this is worthwhile, or should we just make all defaults apply globally?\r\n\r\nJWT defaults can be set either at the project level or global level. By default, the JWT defaults command sets defaults at the project level, defaulting to the project in the current directory. A specific project can be specified via the `--project` option (note you cannot set a default value for `--project`, it is used to indicate which project to set the defaults for). Global default values can be set via the `--global` option (`-g` for short).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --global\r\nGlobal JWT defaults:\r\n  Option        Value\r\n  ------------  ----------------------\r\n  --name        [Environment.UserName]\r\n  --not-before  [DateTime.UtcNow]\r\n  --valid-for   28d\r\n  --scheme      Bearer\r\n  --issuer      dotnet-user-jwts\r\n  --audience   [ApplicationUrl]\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --valid-for 7d --global\r\nDefault value of --valid-for was set to 7d\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --name --reset --global\r\nDefault value of --name was set to [Environment.UserName]\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --reset --global\r\nDefault values for all JWT options were reset\r\n$ \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Resetting default values\r\n\r\nDefault values can be reset to their in-box defaults via the `--reset` option. Each option that should be reset can be supplied via their respective option. If no other options are supplied then all values are reset.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --name --reset\r\nDefault value of --name was reset to [Environment.UserName]\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --valid-for --not-before --reset\r\nDefault value of --valid-for was reset to 28d\r\nDefault value of --not-before was reset to [DateTime.UtcNow]\r\n$ dotnet user-jwts defaults --reset\r\nDefault values for all JWT options were reset\r\n$ \r\n```",

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nMy current specific problem is that I want to use SASS (specifically, `Component.razor.scss` files) in my Blazor WebAssembly projects.  I have already managed to make this work for regular builds and `dotnet watch` full rebuilds by adding this to my project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u003cPropertyGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cLibSassOutputStyle\u003ecompressed\u003c/LibSassOutputStyle\u003e\r\n    \u003cLibSassOutputStyle Condition=\"\u0027$(Configuration)\u0027 == \u0027Debug\u0027\"\u003eexpanded\u003c/LibSassOutputStyle\u003e\r\n\u003c/PropertyGroup\u003e\r\n\u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cPackageReference Include=\"LibSassBuilder\" Version=\"2.0.1\" /\u003e\r\n\u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n\u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cContent Remove=\"**/*.scss\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003cSassFile Update=\"**/*.scss\" CopyToPublishDirectory=\"Never\" /\u003e\r\n\u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n\u003cTarget Name=\"BuildScopedSass\" BeforeTargets=\"ResolveScopedCssInputs\" DependsOnTargets=\"LibSass_Build\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n        \u003c!-- Clean the metadata for these files --\u003e\r\n        \u003cNone Remove=\"**/*.razor.css\" /\u003e\r\n        \u003cNone Include=\"**/*.razor.css\" /\u003e\r\n    \u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n\u003c/Target\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis builds the CSS files in the right places and everything just seems to work -- for full builds.  (Although with the caveat that you need to put them into `.gitignore`, since it doesn\u0027t appear to be possible to build them to an intermediate directory instead.)\r\n\r\nBut with a `dotnet watch` running, editing and saving the `.scss` file is just seen as a \"static file\" and it reloads without actually building the CSS files, so I have to force a full rebuild.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a repeat of #39609 (which was closed and locked from lack of discussion, so I am posting a new issue as the bot requested).\r\n\r\nIt would be good to get some documentation on how to integrate additional tools with the hot reload process, either via tools that have their own built-in watch functionality or (probably simpler) via some project rules that can express \"if these file patterns change then run this build command/target before reloading\"; or just a documented target that can be hooked to run additional build targets, perhaps conditionally on the changed file list.  The expectation is that these would mostly be for static assets, but perhaps source generators could be supported too?\r\n\r\nOr alternatively, to just include sass support as a first-class citizen (which is #24420).  But then this question will come up again next time someone wants to use some other tool.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Clone https://github.com/uecasm/HotReloadStyles.git\r\n2. Launch with `dotnet watch`\r\n3. Observe that, as expected, the scoped styles from both `Index.razor.css` in the main app and `Component1.razor.css` in the library have been merged, resulting in (including border, padding, and green background):\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/539951/174922978-79a40bfb-1799-44ce-956f-1caea8e3d41f.png)\r\n4. Simply re-save the `Index.razor.css` file without making any changes.\r\n5. Observe that, not as expected, the `Index.razor.css` styles still apply but the `Component1.razor.css` styles have been lost (no border or padding but still green background):\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/539951/174923110-83fbb111-7954-4615-b579-04d36c9f912b.png)\r\n6. Press Ctrl-R or relaunch `dotnet watch` and observe that all styles are loaded again.\r\n\r\nPossibly also of note is that editing the `Component1.razor.css` file does update the styles if editing `Index.razor.css` has not yet unloaded them, but does not restore them after it has.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n6.0.300\n\n### Anything else?\n\n```\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19041\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  70ae3df4a6\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.511 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```",

I\u0027m working on a Blazor Server app and using VS Code + dotnet CLI to build, run the app. App is using .NET 7.0.\r\n\r\n@uecasm described the behaviour very well above [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42332#issuecomment-1162527991). The first time the app is run, the scoped styles for the app contain an import of the razor class library scoped styles. When scoped styles in the app are changed and a hot reload occurs, that import statement is lost / removed.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary workaround for now, I have explicitly referenced the bundled CSS of the RCL in the _Host.cshtml file, like so...\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\u003clink href=\"_content/ClassLib/ClassLib.bundle.scp.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still think it would be nice to fix the underlying hot reload import issue, as isolating components / design systems to RCLs so that they can be referenced in multiple projects is imo a common pattern / use case. So casting my vote for a higher priority for this issue in the backlog. Cheers! 🍻",

        "body":  "As a result of the problems experienced by some customers in their ASP.NET Core apps when the browser refresh script is auto-injected, as detailed in #32767, I’m proposing that we add a new launch settings/profile property that can be used to disable the automatic injection of the browser refresh script.\r\n\r\nThe property would be named `disableBrowserRefreshScriptInjection` and would default to `false`. Setting this property to `true` in a launch profile in `launchSettings.json` would prevent `dotnet watch` and Visual Studio from injecting the middleware that writes out the browser refresh JavaScript to HTML responses from the app, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"iisSettings\": {\r\n    \"windowsAuthentication\": false,\r\n    \"anonymousAuthentication\": true,\r\n    \"iisExpress\": {\r\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"http://localhost:50226/\",\r\n      \"sslPort\": 44355\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"profiles\": {\r\n    \"IIS Express\": {\r\n      \"commandName\": \"IISExpress\",\r\n      \"launchBrowser\": true,\r\n      \"disableBrowserRefreshScriptInjection\": true,\r\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\r\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"https\": {\r\n      \"commandName\": \"Project\",\r\n      \"launchBrowser\": true,\r\n      \"disableBrowserRefreshScriptInjection\": true,\r\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\r\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7089;http://localhost:5089\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this setting should not disable any other part of the mechanism that enables browser refreshing on Hot Reload, project build, CSS file change, etc., so that the app can manually add the required JavaScript reference manually, e.g.\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n@* Render the browser reload script *@\r\n@if (Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"__ASPNETCORE_BROWSER_TOOLS\") != null)\r\n{\r\n\u003cscript src=\"/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\r\n}\r\n```",

        "body":  "Related EPIC #41990\r\n\r\nVisual Studio\u0027s container and WSL tools today automatically export the ASP.NET Core HTTPS dev cert from the host machine and import it into the application container or WSL instance as part of the launch experience. As the dev cert is the same as used by the Windows host, browsers running on the host continue to trust it despite it being served from the container or WSL and thus no warnings or errors are shown. This results in a smooth default experience when using ASP.NET Core with HTTPS in Visual Studio with containers or WSL.\r\n\r\nOutside of Visual Studio however is a different story. To remove the errors and warnings associated with the dev cert requires manually exporting the certificate (via dotnet dev-certs https) on the host OS and then configuring it within the context of where the app is running (i.e. container image or WSL). In the case of WSL the dotnet dev-certs-https tool could be updated to support configuring the dev-cert for WSL by compiling a self-contained, single exe, trimmed app to perform operations on the WSL distro ([rough prototype](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/javiercn/dev-certs-wsl)).\r\n\r\nUpdate `dotnet dev-certs https` commands to support WSL via `dotnet dev-certs https --wsl` (create, trust, export, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My project is also referencing the third-party library `MudBlazor` and when I do `dotnet publish -c Debug -o \u003cpath\u003e` the output is just fine, i.e. MudBlazor is below the `dev/_content` folder:\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20972129/233334293-cd632aa2-72e8-4715-828c-37eac70c0054.png)\r\n\r\nBut when I run `dotnet watch` the files are not located under the `dev/_content` path but directly under `_content` (\r\nthe target framework is `net7.0`):\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20972129/233333259-3dbc5888-48f0-4cef-9074-51ee9b7db2c6.png)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect that `\u003cStaticWebAssetBasePath\u003edev\u003c/StaticWebAssetBasePath\u003e` is also applied to third-party libraries when running `dotnet watch`. \r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run \r\n```bash\r\ndotnet new blazorwasm \r\ndotnet add package MudBlazor\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Edit the `.csproj` file and add `\u003cStaticWebAssetBasePath\u003edev\u003c/StaticWebAssetBasePath\u003e`.\r\n3. Run `dotnet publish`\r\n4.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen I add a constructor for dependency injection to my controller (while hot reloading is enabled) i receive a runtime error:\r\n\r\n`InvalidOperationException: Multiple constructors accepting all given argument types have been found in type \u0027MyApplication.UserController\u0027. There should only be one applicable constructor.`\r\n\r\nThis issue is resolved by restarting the build, but I should not have to rebuild and restart my application every time a constructor is added to a controller. (Especially without a hint to do so)\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, hot reloading fails upon then removing the private property and constructor again with a warning that this change requires a restart of the application. This does not happen in the first step of adding the constructor.\r\n\r\n**Code for reference:**\r\n\r\nUserController.cs\r\n```csharp\r\n[Route(\"users\")]\r\n[ApiController]\r\npublic class UserController : Controller\r\n{\r\n    private readonly ILogger\u003cUserController\u003e _logger; // adding this\r\n\r\n    public UserController(ILogger\u003cUserController\u003e logger) // and this\r\n    {\r\n        _logger = logger;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [HttpGet(\"\")]\r\n    public IActionResult GetAll()\r\n    {\r\n        _logger.LogInformation(\"Hello from Logger\"); // will result in error using hot reloading\r\n        return Ok(\"Hello from /users\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [HttpGet(\"info\")]\r\n    public IActionResult GetInfo()\r\n    {\r\n        return Ok(\"Hello from /users/info\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [HttpGet(\"{id:int}\")]\r\n    public IActionResult GetOne(int id)\r\n    {\r\n        return Ok(\"Hello from /users/\" + id);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nHot Reloading using (dotnet watch) should not result in `InvalidOperationException: Multiple constructors accepting all given argument types have been found` while adding a constructor to a previously constructor-less controller.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a ASP.NET webapi (minimal api) project.\r\n2. Configure the controller service on the builder (`builder.Services.AddControllers();`) and enable the controller route mapping on the application instance (`app.MapControllers();`).\r\n3. Add a simple controller without a constructor.\r\n4. Start the application with hot reload enabled (`$ dotnet watch`).\r\n5. Add a constructor (meant for DI) to the controller.\r\n6. Save the file that of the affected controller (hot reload should take place).\r\n7. Notice that the added constructor breaks the controller upon making a HTTP request.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nInvalidOperationException: Multiple constructors accepting all given argument types have been found in type \u0027FinanceManager.UserController\u0027. There should only be one applicable constructor.\n\n### .NET Version\n\n7.0.305\n\n### Anything else?\n\n**My Environment**\r\n\r\n- Apple Silicon M1 Max\r\n- macOS Ventura 13.3.1\r\n- dotNet SDK 7.0.305\r\n- Jetbrains Rider, ASP.NET webapi, \"http\" run config\r\n\r\n**dotnet --info**\r\n\r\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:   7.0.305\r\n Commit:    98e1b6c381\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\r\n OS Version:  13.3\r\n OS Platform: Darwin\r\n RID:         osx.13-arm64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/7.0.305/\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      7.0.8\r\n  Architecture: arm64\r\n  Commit:       4b0550942d\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  6.0.303 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.101 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n  7.0.305 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.1 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.1 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nOther architectures found:\r\n  None\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables:\r\n  Not set\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  Not found",

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m using hot reload with Razor Pages (v7).\r\n\r\nSometimes I make changes in my IDE and don\u0027t want the page to be reloaded in the browser after I save.\r\n\r\nUse cases:\r\n- I make changes to the page via the devtools, and if the page is reloaded then those changes would be lost\r\n- I\u0027m interacting with some remote API and don\u0027t want to lose such state\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\n\r\nThere [are ways](https://stackoverflow.com/q/68952259/9971404) to disable hot reload, but that\u0027s not what I want - I want to keep using it, but to disable it per page, on demand, from the frontend itself. For example, I want to inject a button into the page with a script that disables hot reload.\r\n\r\nThe `_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js` script is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/release/7.0.2xx/src/BuiltInTools/BrowserRefresh/WebSocketScriptInjection.js).\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution is for the id to be saved to some global variable with a specific name, for example:\r\n```js\r\nwindow[\u0027hotReloadTimerId\u0027] = setTimeout(/*...*/);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we could disable it with:\r\n```js\r\nclearTimeout(window[\u0027hotReloadTimerId\u0027]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI tried this without success:\r\n```js\r\nwindow[\u0027_dotnet_watch_ws_injected\u0027] = 1;\r\n```\r\nI don\u0027t know why that doesn\u0027t work.",

And the form keeps its current state while updating the styling. To illustrate this I\u0027ve added this item group to my .csproj file.\r\n```\r\n\u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n        \u003cContent Remove=\"wwwroot\\**\\*.json\"/\u003e\r\n        \u003cContent Remove=\"wwwroot\\**\\*.js\"/\u003e\r\n\r\n        \u003cContent Include=\"wwwroot\\**\\*.js\" Watch=\"false\"/\u003e\r\n        \u003cContent Include=\"wwwroot\\**\\*.json\" Watch=\"false\"/\u003e\r\n\u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n```\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/1363512/853b6b57-7907-481d-aba0-cd54b69bc455)\r\nChanging the background color again.\r\n```\r\ndotnet watch ⌚ Files changed: .\\wwwroot\\assets\\asyncExample.css, .\\wwwroot\\assets\\main.css\r\ndotnet watch 🔥 Hot reload of static file succeeded.\r\ndotnet watch 🔥 Hot reload of static file succeeded.\r\n\r\n```\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/assets/1363512/e7570d02-566a-43d1-9b32-ee778fd3177a)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen only static assets change i expect the form state to remain the same\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.200\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nI am working on an MVC app with some peculiar requirements regarding page reloads and resubmitting forms. I do like developing with `dotnet watch run`  for the hot reloading, but sometimes the restrictions my app enforces clashes with automatic reloads caused by the hot reload browser integration. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\n\r\nI would like to selectively disable certain auto-reload scenarios in the browser script, preferably without also having to restart the entire application.\r\n\r\n1. Option to not reload the current page if (and only if) is the result of a POST request.\r\n2. Option to not automatically refresh the current page (but to still reload assets, scripts and css)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe POST response reload is particularly frustrating sometimes, as my browser of choice also asks me to confirm the reload, causing further development friction.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this is not about disabling the integration entirely (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/54107), though having that option would also help.",

I don\u0027t know the details of what or why, but it is generating some files the first time it runs.  Some of those files happen to have a `.cs` extension.  They are not C# files, but happen to have the same extension.  When Hot Reload is enabled, it detects a new `.cs` file has been created and restarts the app making it impossible to generate a pdf.\r\n\r\nRunning `dotnet watch --list` does not list anything in the bin directory.  Editing an existing `.cs` file in the bin directory does not seem to be recognized as an edit (rude or otherwise).  It only seems to recognize when a file has been added.\r\n\r\nI also tried adding this to the `.csproj`:\r\n```\r\n\u003cItemGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cWatch Remove=\"bin/**/*.cs\"/\u003e\r\n\u003c/ItemGroup\u003e\r\n```\r\nIt didn\u0027t help.  I assume this is because it would only remove files from the initial watch list, which doesn\u0027t include files in the bin directory anyway.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nHot Reload should ignore new files in the `bin` directory.  Failing that, I would have expected it to respect the `\u003cWatch Remove=\"\"\u003e`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nCreate a new .NET 8 project from template.  I used the \"Web API\" template.\r\n\r\nRun `dotnet watch run`.\r\n\r\nCopy any `.cs` file into `/bin/Debug/net8.0`.  It can be empty or have any contents.\r\n\r\nThe following log is displayed and the app is restarted:\r\n\u003e dotnet watch ⌚ New file: .\\bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\New.cs. Rebuilding the application.\r\n\r\nIt does not even present the \"rude edit\" message and options, it just restarts.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.300\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "Playing around with the OpenAPI document CLI generation from [_Lint generated OpenAPI documents with Spectral_](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/aspnetcore-openapi?view=aspnetcore-9.0#lint-generated-openapi-documents-with-spectral) I found a few issues and rough edges. Rather than create lots of small issues I figured I\u0027d list them all here, and they can be spun off into dedicated issues based on feedback/triage.\r\n\r\n#### OpenApiDocumentsDirectory is not resolved to a full path\r\n\r\nIf `OpenApiDocumentsDirectory` is specified as a relative path (e.g. `dotnet build ./src/API /p:OpenApiGenerateDocuments=true /p:OpenApiDocumentsDirectory=\"./artifacts/openapi\"`), the path is not resolved to a full path, and then ends up as a path relative to the tool invocation, rather than relative to the current working directory of the command, so the document ends up in the `bin\\Debug` etc. folder rather than the folder the user expected.\r\n\r\nSeems like resolving the full path here in the MSBuild targets before invoking the tool would resolve that: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/06155c05af89c957de20d2c53cee0e37171b9a09/src/Tools/Extensions.ApiDescription.Server/src/build/Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server.targets#L56\r\n\r\n#### \"Invalid OpenAPI spec version\" warning\r\n\r\nIf the target is run without explicitly an OpenAPI document version to generate, a warning is output:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGenerating document named \u0027api\u0027.\r\nUsing discovered `GenerateAsync` overload with version parameter.\r\nInvalid OpenAPI spec version \u0027\u0027 provided. Falling back to default: v3.0.\r\nWriting document named \u0027api\u0027 to \u0027./artifacts/openapi\\API_api.json\u0027.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis comes from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/06155c05af89c957de20d2c53cee0e37171b9a09/src/Tools/GetDocumentInsider/src/Commands/GetDocumentCommandWorker.cs#L329\r\n\r\nIf this `Enum.TryParse()` call fails to parse anything:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/06155c05af89c957de20d2c53cee0e37171b9a09/src/Tools/GetDocumentInsider/src/Commands/GetDocumentCommandWorker.cs#L323\r\n\r\nIt looks like there\u0027s a few ways to resolve this:\r\n\r\n1. Assign a default value for `GetDocumentCommandContext.OpenApiVersion` if no value is provided: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/06155c05af89c957de20d2c53cee0e37171b9a09/src/Tools/GetDocumentInsider/src/Commands/GetDocumentCommand.cs#L141\r\n2. Don\u0027t emit the warning if `GetDocumentCommandContext.OpenApiVersion` is null/empty (rather than a value that doesn\u0027t parse)\r\n3. Explicitly pass a value for `--openapi-version`  through from the MSBuild target: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/06155c05af89c957de20d2c53cee0e37171b9a09/src/Tools/GetDocumentInsider/src/Commands/GetDocumentCommand.cs#L33\r\n\r\n#### No MSBuild property for specifying the OpenAPI version\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s possible to add extra options to work around the above using `OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOptions` (e.g. `/p:OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOptions=\"--openapi-version OpenApi3_0\"`), but there isn\u0027t a specific MSBuild property for this.\r\n\r\nTo make usage easier a property could be defined that the user can specify to set the version without needing to explicitly set command line parameters that the MSBuild target could transform and pass through to the tool (e.g. `/p:OpenApiGenerateDocumentVersion=3.0` into `--openapi-version OpenApi3_0`).\r\n\r\n#### MSBuild properties not affecting \"up-to-date-ness\"\r\n\r\nI noticed when the path wasn\u0027t being fully evaluated, if I re-ran the build with a different input property the document wouldn\u0027t be regenerated.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n❯ dotnet build ./src/API /p:OpenApiGenerateDocuments=true /p:OpenApiDocumentsDirectory=\"${OutputDirectory}\"\r\nRestore complete (1.9s)\r\nYou are using a preview version of .NET. See: https://aka.ms/dotnet-support-policy\r\n  API succeeded (16.5s) → artifacts\\bin\\API\\debug\\API.dll\r\n\r\nBuild succeeded in 21.8s\r\n\r\napi on  dotnet-nightly [$] via .NET v9.0.100-preview.7.24375.12 took 22s\r\n❯ dotnet build ./src/API /p:OpenApiGenerateDocuments=true /p:OpenApiDocumentsDirectory=\"${OutputDirectory}2\"\r\nRestore complete (0.5s)\r\nYou are using a preview version of .NET. See: https://aka.ms/dotnet-support-policy\r\n  API succeeded (1.0s) → artifacts\\bin\\API\\debug\\API.dll\r\n\r\nBuild succeeded in 4.4s\r\n\r\napi on  dotnet-nightly [$] via .NET v9.0.100-preview.7.24375.12 took 4s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first command creates the API document at `${OutputDirectory}` in ~20 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe second command with the output path set to `${OutputDirectory}2` doesn\u0027t emit anything and takes ~4 seconds.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the properties being passed through aren\u0027t affecting MSBuild up-to-date checks and causing the document not to be re-generated.\r\n\r\n#### Output directory value isn\u0027t checked for\r\n\r\nI made a mistake during playing with the tool and accidentally un-defined the variable for the output path. This then causes an `ArgumentException` to be thrown inside the tool (`--output \"\"`). Should something check a value is specified first?\r\n\r\n```console\r\n❯ dotnet build ./src/API /p:OpenApiGenerateDocuments=true /p:OpenApiDocumentsDirectory=\"${OutputDirectory}\" /p:OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOptions=\"--openapi-version OpenApi3_0\"\r\nRestore complete (0.6s)\r\nYou are using a preview version of .NET.

You\u0027ll observe this in the rather hokey use of the \"pubternal\" `IDocumentProvider` interface that both NSwag and Swashbuckle implement and the fact that they clobber over MSBuild properties defined in the package.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, I\u0027d like to move away from the use of this package for build-time document generation and move to something more built-in to the `M.A.OpenApi` package. It doesn\u0027t seem like the package is playing a good role being an abstraction layer for packages given that both NSwag and Swashbuckle implement their own CLIs anyways. The fact that this logic exists in a separate package also makes it hard to discover for users.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve been conservative about the changes made to this package for .NET 9 in anticipation of exploring a possible rewrite for this in the future.\r\n\r\nHere\u0027s a braindump of some of the things I\u0027ve been thinking about here:\r\n\r\n- The current implementation uses an internal executable that is called via MSBuild, so there\u0027s massaging that needs to be done when mapping the MSBuild arguments to arguments for the CLI tool. IMO, we should ship either a tool or stick to MSBuild targets. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much value in providing half-baked support for both.\r\n- The current implementation is intended to work with tools like Swashbuckle, which support a wider set of target frameworks that we intend to. Moving to a different approach would allow us to remove code/packaging logic related to unsupported frameworks (netfx, netstandard).\r\n- I\u0027d like to standardize the configuration story for build-time document generation so there\u0027s an official schema exposed via options (similar to what you get with Aspire\u0027s config model) to improve the discoverability of these options.\r\n\r\nSo, all this to say, I agree that the tool is carrying a lot of cruft, but my current thinking is that exploring a full rewrite within M.A.OpenApi is a better strategy in the long-term.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

This would be above my bar for things I\u0027d feel OK including at this point given the friction point that was identified. It\u0027s also good signal for the kinds of things people care about customizing in a possible rewrite.\r\n\r\nThe OpenAPI version option was introduced in this release for a similar reason. There were some niche scenarios in VS where you needed to override the version configured in `OpenApiOptions` and always serialize to OpenAPI v2 to acount for some tools that didn\u0027t support v3. I intentionally avoided including an MSBuild option for it for the scenarios I mentioned above about the weirdness between shuffling between MSBuild and CLI args and because I\u0027d really like to avoid exposing users to too many configurability points for the same value.\r\n\r\n\u003e I\u0027d be happy to tackle any that are wanted (and can make it in time for .NET 9) - just let me know which ones. \r\n\r\nI think things like fully qualifying `OpenApiDocumentsDirectory` and fixing up the erroneous warnings on OpenAPI spec version seem worthwhile to do for .NET 9. As far as timelines, there\u0027s a little less than two weeks left for changes.\r\n\r\nThe other unfortunate thing about the tool is the testing story is a little subpar. I added some tests for it in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/55823 but we definitely don\u0027t have the kind of coverage I\u0027d like to see as we make changes...",

On one hand it seems like a VS tooling issue, on the other it seems like fixing it potentially changes how certs are loaded in aspnetcore.\r\n\r\nWhen you use a standard naming convention for projects within a solution, for instance, you call you blazor projects Web and have two different solutions open at the same time one of them ends up with the wrong passphrase for the certificate and an error that it can\u0027t find the certificate even though you can clearly see the Web.pfx certificate mounted in the container.\r\n\r\nBest I can tell this is ultimately caused by the fact VS tooling overwrites that Web.pfx certificate in %APPDATA% when the second project goes to run leaving the first project with a certificate that is named properly, but the wrong passphrase because it\u0027s user secrets contained the passphrase for the original Web.pfx that was created.\r\n\r\nI believe a way to resolve this conflict would be to simply use the user secrets id as the certificate name which kind of ties it together for any developer digging in to understand and eliminates the ambiguity in file names that ultimately causes this issue int he first place.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### .NET Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIn our .net 8 project we are using `dotnet watch` to make use of live updates for UI changes in our MVC application. This process works well except sometimes when hot reloading is not working anymore. When this occurs changing some text in a `cshtml` file does not trigger an reload of the web browser. The output of `dotnet watch` for any file within the project is something like this:\n\n```\nFile changed: ./Views/x/y.cshtml.\nNo hot reload changes to apply.\n```\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that this detection is quite slow (seconds) compared to the usual detection within milliseconds.\n\nNow we have already found a a quick fix that might lead to the cause. At least \"Rider\" (Maybe also other IDEs) sometimes add new/changed files to the `csproj` file as an `ItemGroup` like so:\n\n```\n \u003cItemGroup\u003e\n    \u003cAdditionalFiles Include=\"Areas\\Admin\\Views\\x\\y.cshtml\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/ItemGroup\u003e \n```\n\nWhen something like that happens hot reloading does not work anymore (like written above) until this line is removed. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected behavior is, that `dotnet watch` always works and is not easily broken by such changes or that some more logs are written to help to solve the issue.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n8.0.401\n\n### Anything else?\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           8.0.401\n Commit:            811edcc344\n Workload version:  8.0.400-manifests.57f7c351\n MSBuild version:   17.11.4+37eb419ad\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.0\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/8.0.401/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n [aspire]\n   Installation Source: SDK 8.0.400\n   Manifest Version:    8.2.0/8.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk-manifests/8.0.100/microsoft.net.sdk.aspire/8.2.0/WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0-rc.2.24473.5\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       990ebf52fc\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.401 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n  9.0.100-rc.2.24474.11 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk].  \u003c--- It is not related to that, I had this before installing 9\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24474.3 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0-rc.2.24473.5 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  None\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  /Users/xx/Developer/xx/global.json\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download",

You\u0027re correct that the docs are currently incorrect about the default output directory.\n\n\u003e A second strange behavior I\u0027ve found is if you delete this file and rebuild you won\u0027t get a new file until you\u0027ve either changed something about your server code or cleaned your project. I would ideally like to recreate this file if it is missing regardless of the other incremental build optimizations dotnet uses.\n\nYeah, unfortunately the current strategy is plagued with incrementally issues. :/\n\nThis is a good opportunity to dupe this bug report to https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58353. The `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` implementation predates the OpenAPI support we shipped in .NET 9 and was optimized for use with third-party libraries like Swashbuckle and NSwag. With the new built-in support, we\u0027re hoping to reconcile build-time generation into the M.A.OpenApi package and provide a more sensible configuration and execution behavior compared the existing approach.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nI have been looking for a manner to trigger a hot reload in my browser after a service reloads some JSON files.\n\nI don\u0027t want the watcher to consider my changes to the JSON files as rude edits, so I\u0027m not adding them to the list of watched files. I have already provided a mechanism for developers to reload the files via a PhysicalFileProvider, copying the files from the source path to the debug build path, and reloading them in memory when a debugger is attached or the environment variables for DOTNET_WATCH is 1.  But I have found no way to let the browser know that it should refresh. I have tried sending  empty updates via `MetadataUpdater.ApplyUpdate` as a hackish way to trigger a notification, but that (expectedly) failed.\n\nI think it would help tremendously the DX, especially for those of us working on new libraries.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nA simple class injected (or not) that gives you a a watcher context, fulfilling this contract:\n\n```csharp\ninterface IWatcherContext\n{\n    bool HasWatcher { get; } // Is the application running through dotnet watch?\n    bool IsHotReloadEnabled { get; } // Is the hot reload option enabled\n    bool IsBrowserRefreshEnabled { get; } // Is browser refresh option enabled\n    void NotifyBrowser(); // Notifies the browser that it needs to refresh.\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Please describe the problem.\n\nIt would be helpful to be able to retrieve and generate dev certs programmatically.\n\nCurrently, we have to use some hacky way to retrieve it programmatically (see https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/pull/667/files).\n\nAnother limitation of the current situation is that since the cert is only valid for `localhost`, so if an app is running in a container and needs to access another service on the host, there will be an SSL error since requests will be done against `https://host.docker.internal`. Same issue with other container services running with short names, like `https://catalog` for example.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n- A public interface to interact with the dev cert (at least get the current one)\n- Ideally a way to add alternative subject name to support the container case.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

                                           "body":  "The code in question is currently shared between `dotnet dev-certs` and Kestrel itself, and it\u0027s internal in both places. Making it public would require a pretty extensive API review and we\u0027d need to decide where it would even live such that things like Aspire could use it. Note that the Aspire app host project doesn\u0027t even reference ASP.NET Core today so wouldn\u0027t be able to use the API from Kestrel even if it were public.\n\nMy preference for the Aspire scenario (dotnet/aspire#7756) is that we rely on the command line tool, rather than try introduce another party this code needs to be shared/synced with. Orchestrating external tools is very much what Aspire does already for lots of things and I think it\u0027s simpler approach in this case (but I\u0027m willing to be convinced otherwise).\n\nThat said, to better support this model, I think `dotnet dev-certs` should support a structured output mode (like other dotnet CLI commands do) so that it\u0027s more reliable to orchestrate it. E.g. right now it doesn\u0027t output the actual certificate details (like the thumbprints) unless run with the `-v` flag, and the output isn\u0027t at all friendly to tooling.\n\nRE the subject alternative names, we simply need the two known container host network hostnames (`host.docker.internal` and `host.containers.interanl`) to be supported as SANs for the HTTPS dev cert, so the simplest thing would be to just version the cert and adds those two SANs. They\u0027re both local only and use the newly reserved `.internal` sub-domain so there aren\u0027t new concerns introduced related to having the cert support non-local domains (as this cert is self-signed and trusted as part of our standard dev experience flows, we\u0027re particular about what hosts it\u0027s valid for from a security point of view, /Cc @blowdart). In the future there might be scope to expand the SANs to better support other more advanced local development scenarios using hostnames other than \"localhost\", but that\u0027s not today.\n\nThe `dotnet dev-certs https` and Kestrel dev cert support already supports the idea of versioning the cert without changing the OID, and the code is written such that the version check is a `\u003e=` so if you have a newer version than the code knows about, it\u0027s still considered valid. That said, we\u0027ll need to consider scenarios such as running with a new ASP.NET Core version (runtime) than SDK version, as today the code is simply shared and there\u0027s no provision for each to support a different min version, but that shouldn\u0027t be a complicated change (we just need to know to consider it). I think we essentially need to increment the version used by `dotnet dev-certs` (i.e. for creating, trusting, exporting, etc. the cert), but not the version used by ASP.NET Core for finding and loading the cert. That way, a patched Kestrel will honor the existing cert, even if the SDK on the machine hasn\u0027t been updated and thus the new version of the cert laid down.\n\nAlso, the Aspire scenario we want to enable with these changes needs to work for the .NET 8 or .NET 9 SDKs too (as Aspire supports those versions) so these changes need to backported to 8.0.1xx and 9.0.1xx so they\u0027re available everywhere.",

However, when running dotnet dev-certs https --check --verbose, it still indicates that the certificate is in an invalid state:\n\n```bash\n[1] Listing certificates from CurrentUser\\My\n[2] Found certificates: 1 certificate\n    1) 7F6836DFD574CEC99B2230FF461F3E7334F176FC - CN=localhost - Valid from 2025-02-18 13:46:56Z to 2026-02-18 13:46:56Z - IsHttpsDevelopmentCertificate: true - IsExportable: true\n[3] Checking certificates validity\n[4] Valid certificates: 1 certificate\n    1) 7F6836DFD574CEC99B2230FF461F3E7334F176FC - CN=localhost - Valid from 2025-02-18 13:46:56Z to 2026-02-18 13:46:56Z - IsHttpsDevelopmentCertificate: true - IsExportable: true\n[5] Invalid certificates: no certificates\n[6] Finished listing certificates.\nThe ASP.NET Core developer certificate is in an invalid state. To fix this issue, run \u0027dotnet dev-certs https --clean\u0027 and \u0027dotnet dev-certs https\u0027 to remove all existing ASP.NET Core development certificates and create a new untrusted developer certificate. Use \u0027dotnet dev-certs https --trust\u0027 to trust the new certificate.\n```\n\n### Solutions I’ve Already Tried\n\t1.\tRunning dotnet dev-certs https --clean and dotnet dev-certs https --trust multiple times.\n\t2.\tDeleting the ~/.aspnet/https/ directory.\n\t3.\tManually deleting all localhost related certificates in Keychain Access.\n\t4.\tRestarting the system and rerunning the above certificate generation and trust steps.\n\t5.\tManually setting the new localhost certificate in Keychain to Always Trust.\n\nHowever, all of these attempts have been unsuccessful, and every time I run dotnet dev-certs https --check, it still shows that the certificate is in an invalid state.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nRunning dotnet dev-certs https --check should show that the certificate is valid, and no invalid certificate message should appear.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nEven though the certificate is shown as present and trusted, it still reports “The ASP.NET Core developer certificate is in an invalid state.”\n\n### Additional Information\n\t•\tIs there a known compatibility issue with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)?\n\t•\tIs there a known issue with certificate tools on macOS Sonoma 15.3?\n\n### Thank you!",

We\u0027re tracking improvements to the build-time generation space via https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58353. Specifically, the proposal is to build on top of a new `IApiPublisher` API to support generation (see https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/61031).\n\nI can see us achieving this in one of two ways in the new model coming in .NET 10:\n\n- Registering two publishers `openapi-yaml` and `openapi-json` for each format\n- Adding the document format to `OpenApiOptions` although this might not play well with the YAML endpoint that we previously created",

Clone the repro: [Hot reload repro](https://github.com/modplug/HotReload)\n2. dotnet watch the `HotReload` project\n3. Modify `wwwroot/shared.css` in the `HotReload.RazorClassLibrary` project\n4.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI have a large-ish project with a dotnet backend, typescript frontend, redis, db etc - so naturally I\u0027m going to reach for a Docker Compose stack. This works fairly well, except that as far as I can tell it\u0027s not possible to cleanly support debugging *and* hot reload in this scenario. I can either:\n- Disable hot reload, and use a docker attach debugging config. This works great, except as the project grows I end up spending significant time waiting on builds for minor changes, especially with multiple projects depending on each other.\n- Use hot reload, and give up on debugging. Maybe I\u0027m missing something, but all attempts to attach give a \"Attaching a .NET debugger to this process is not allowed because code changes have been applied. The process must be restarted to allow debugging.\" error. Ideally, I\u0027d run a preLaunch task to force a full restart, but the only way I\u0027ve found to do that is \"press ctrl-r\" which I can\u0027t easily do to a running docker container.\n\nI\u0027ve searched the docs and Google and haven\u0027t seen anything relating to this situation, but I can\u0027t imagine I\u0027m the only one using dotnet core as one piece of a larger full-stack context. I think some additional docs around running dotnet in docker, and what\u0027s possible/not possible might be warranted. The dev experience with debugger attaching in general is really good, I feel like this is my last blocker to the ideal workflow.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI think there\u0027s a few possible fixes here:\n- Automatically restart fully when a debugger is attached, if there are hot changes applied. This seems like the most obvious, so I assume it\u0027s hard in some way.\n- Support debugging when there are hot changes\n- Support an alternate method to request a full reload than a keyboard shortcut that presumes you\u0027re running dotnet in a standard terminal context.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nA higher-level fix would be faster non-hot-reload builds - I\u0027m not entirely clear what\u0027s taking so long in the first place. Is there a way to profile builds that my Googling hasn\u0027t surfaced?",

Please describe the problem.\n\nrunning a `dotnet build` on an ASP.NET Core project, does not indicate when `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` runs the `GetDocument` tool. This is due to dotnet\u0027s new Terminal Logger, introduced in .NET 8.\n\nBuilding with the new Terminal Logger disabled `dotnet build  --tl:off` does show the logs from the tool invocation, including `Generating document named \u0027v1\u0027`.\n\nHowever, building with a Terminal Logger Verbosity flag set to detailed `dotnet build -tlp:v=d` does show the GetDocument logs.\n\nSomeone who is unaware these logs exist, will never be able to find them.\nThis can be an issue when debugging document generation.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nSurface these logs when using the new Terminal Logger, which is the default logger.

Happy for this to be closed if nothing can be improved :)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRepro: https://github.com/MattParkerDev/Repro.AspnetCoreOpenApiDocBuild\nUsing .NET 10 preview 4\n\n1. Build sln once\n2. Observe WebApi.json - endpoint path is `MyEndpoint1`\n3. Update the path in `ClassLibContainingEndpoint.Endpoints`\n4. Observe the path has not changed in WebApi.json, and that the document generation did not run (`dotnet build -tlp:v=d` or `dotnet build  --tl:off` to see tool invocation in logs)\n5. Update the endpoint path in `Program.cs`\n6. Observe that the document **is** generated\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-preview.4.25258.110\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Use this before fixating on a particular implementation.\n--\u003e\n\n## Summary\n\nSupport creating custom claims as an array type using the `user-jwts` tool.\n\n## Motivation and goals\n\n- It is a common use case for JWTs to contain custom claims that are an array type. For example:\n```\n{\n   \"fooIds\": [\n         \"427ba6fa-7e92-49ff-b180-944cf0c9e4b8\",\n         \"708f0c8b-c982-47ce-8cfb-c31bc5bc7d73\"\n   ]\n}\n```\n- While the `user-jwts` tool supports creating roles as an array, it does not currently support creating custom claims as an array. \n- By adding this capability to the `user-jwts` tool, it will make it a convenient option for testing applications that do expect custom claims with array types.\n\n## In scope\n\nSupport for creating custom claims as an array.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\ndotnet user-jwts create --claim companies=company1 --claim companies=company2\n```\nThis could result in a token with the claim:\n```\n{\n   \"companies\": [\"company1\", \"company2\"]\n}\n```\n\nBy specifying each entry in the array as another `--claim` flag, it would function similar to how the `--role` flag currently works. If there is only one instance of the key, it would be a single value, and if there are multiple instances of the key, it would become an array.\n\n### Multiple Keys\n```\ndotnet user-jwts create --claim companies=company1 --claim companies=company2\n```\nBecomes:\n```\n{\n   \"companies\": [\"company1\", \"company2\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Single Key\n```\ndotnet user-jwts create --claim company=company1\n```\nBecomes:\n```\n{\n   \"company\": \"company1\"\n}\n```\n\n### Mixed Keys\n```\ndotnet user-jwts create --claim companies=company1 --claim companies=company2 --claim department=engineering\n```\nBecomes:\n```\n{\n   \"companies\": [\"company1\", \"company2\"],\n   \"department\": \"engineering\"\n}\n```\n\n## Existing Issues\n\n[#59671](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/59671)\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n`dotnet watch` in SDKs from 9.0 onwards is much slower with Blazor Server apps than NET8 SDK was.   This has improved very slightly between 9 and 10p6, but is still **much** worse than it used to be.  Updates often take several seconds from editing a file to a component/page re-rendering.\n\nTo avoid subjective discussions about performance I built an application to measure this which, though artificial, gets results that match my real-world experience:    (Blue is 8, Green/Red are 9/10p6)\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1174\" height=\"775\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ef899dc-3b5f-431e-8f3d-eaa285375110\" /\u003e\n\nThe app itself is NET8, and the **only change** between the tests is the global.json to select the SDK.\n\nI know this issue probably belongs in the SDK repo, but I have put it here, because I think bad hot reload represents an existential risk to Blazor and I am a big fan of Blazor and want it to succeed.   I think it\u0027s reasonable to draw attention to big performance regressions, particularly ones which impact dev experience so badly.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBlazor Server hot-reload performance in 10.0 should be approximately the same as in 8.0 (or better, I suppose!)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/willdean/blazor-hot-reload-10p6\n\nThis is two apps - a webapp which measures how much delay there was between source file writing and update and an updater app which modifies a razor component every 2 seconds.\n\nResults are written to a log file in the temp directory.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n10.0.100-preview.6.25358.103\n\n### Anything else?\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-preview.6.25358.103\n Commit:            75972a5ba7\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.6616851e\n MSBuild version:   17.15.0-preview-25358-103+75972a5ba\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-preview.6.25358.103\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36310.24, VS 17.14.36202.13\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.0-preview.5.25306.5/10.0.100-preview.5\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.5\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\10.0.0-preview.5.25306.5\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [aspire]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36310.24, VS 17.14.36202.13\n   Manifest Version:    8.2.2/8.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\8.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.aspire\\8.2.2\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maccatalyst]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36310.24, VS 17.14.36202.13\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.10622-net10-p5/10.0.100-preview.5\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.5\\microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst\\18.4.10622-net10-p5\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [ios]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36310.24, VS 17.14.36202.13\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.10622-net10-p5/10.0.100-preview.5\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.5\\microsoft.net.sdk.ios\\18.4.10622-net10-p5\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [android]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36310.24, VS 17.14.36202.13\n   Manifest Version:    36.0.0-preview.5.116/10.0.100-preview.5\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.5\\microsoft.net.sdk.android\\36.0.0-preview.5.116\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nWorkloads are configured to install and update using workload versions, but none were found.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI have recently been in the process of migrating our old NSWag.MSBuild-based half-baked custom implementation for compile-time API Client generation over to Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Client which very clearly offered support for all of the functionality we need and in a better easier to understand/use package. A good chunk of the way through the effort, I stumbled on this open announcement issue ( https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/518 ) which indicates that everything I\u0027m doing is about to be deprecated 😭😅\n\nI\u0027ve come to make an argument for reconsidering this deprecation. For teams that manage their build processes primarily with MSBuild there is a lot of benefit to having a pre-defined set of item definitions/properties/targets/extension points for this very common activity. We\u0027re currently using Exec with a combination of custom properties/items provided via internal NuGet packages/custom project SDKs and after a few generations of occasional difficulties with orchestrating command line tool timing between multiple projects within a solution we saw there was a first-party way to do this and were excited to move to something likely to be more reliable. Our implementation was not as clean as the abstraction provided in this package and it\u0027s clear you all have stronger expertise for patterns and practices with MSBuild which we can learn from. That said, we follow the same patterns across many solutions/repositories by leveraging NuGet/SDKs/MSBuild to standardize build behaviors and this solution looks really good to us. Of particular improvement for our environment is the `OpenApiProjectReference` for establishing build dependency properly and automatically extracting the spec document path from the API project\u0027s common MSBuild configuration.\n\nIf I\u0027m understanding the announcement correctly, one of the main arguments for deprecation seems to be that it\u0027s \n\n\u003e tightly coupled to certain generators\n\nwhich I imagine are based around it primarily supporting NSwag in its inception. I should think even if a larger portion of the onus were to move to the vendor packages (like `NSwag.ApiDescription.Client`) for building the input parameters/determining behavior around outputs, I think it would be helpful for us folks preferring MSBuild over custom scripts running command line tools between projects to have a framework for common behavior. Pretty much all API client code generators can benefit from knowing the output spec path from the API--especially given there\u0027s built-in functionality for generating the doc now--and want to run after it\u0027s generated and before the Client project is compiled, plus the design-time compilation support is an added bonus we didn\u0027t have in our command-line Exec-based implementation). Could we consider keeping this around and if we want it to be less vendor-specific consider evolving it into something that different vendor packages can leverage instead of providing an out-of-box implementation?\n\nAs for other reasons for deprecation:\n\n\u003e The package has seen minimal updates and maintenance since its introduction.\n\nThis seems like it could be a counter-argument for \n\n\u003e Removing the package reduces maintenance burden and clarifies the recommended workflow for client generation\n\nbut is otherwise possibly an indicator for how little maintenance something so common/simple might really require (i.e. it is more \"stable\" than some things which see more frequent need for updates across versions). As for making the recommended workflow \"more clear\" I\u0027m not so sure it does; if I have a Client project in the same solution as the Server project which share a Contracts library (and they have a conceptual build order dependency) what exactly is the recommended workflow for taking the output spec from one project and having that become an input for generation in the next project building within the solution; what is the most appropriate means to enforce dependency and configure the path to the (intermediate?) spec output file in consuming projects. The CLI tools seem mostly to provide guidance to build one project then call a CLI tool then build another project which is a less than ideal flow for teams preferring to work in Visual Studio and just use Build Solution, F5 debugging, or executing tests from the Test Explorer, which seems to rebut the final change reason about\n\n\u003e making the MSBuild middle-layer redundant\n\nI guess it\u0027s reasonable to expect us all to implement generation to our own preference, but it seems like we\u0027ll end up with a lot of redundant implementations throughout the world, from my perspective.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nCommon integration points which leverage shared knowledge across MSBuild project references to automatically determine the output path for specs generated via `OpenApiGenerateDocuments`, preferably via continued built-in support for `OpenApiProjectReference`.\n\nIf not continuing support for the `NSwagCSharp` output type, perhaps a PR moving some existing functionality over to [NSwag.ApiDescription.Client](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/tree/master/src/NSwag.ApiDescription.Client) in such a way that it extends a shared target that other packages could similarly migrate to (e.g. a kiota-specific package, perhaps maintained in their repository?).\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "### Summary\n\nI’d like to propose a new feature for the .NET CLI to help developers sync and document required user secrets without exposing sensitive values. Specifically, the feature would allow exporting **only the keys** of secrets stored via `dotnet user-secrets` to a file like `appsettings.template.json`.\n\n---\n\n### Problem\n\nIn collaborative or distributed environments, it\u0027s common to use `dotnet user-secrets` for storing sensitive config values locally. However:\n\n- There is no native way to export just the **keys** of secrets to inform other team members or CI/CD pipelines about what environment variables or secrets they need to provide.\n- Developers often forget what keys they had configured, especially when returning to the project after some time.\n- Manual synchronization between user-secrets and `appsettings.json` (or a `.env`-style placeholder file) becomes error-prone.\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a new CLI command (or a flag) to export just the secret keys from the current project’s user-secrets:\n\n```bash\ndotnet user-secrets export --keys-only \u003e appsettings.template.json\n\n``` \n\n\nOr as a separate command:\n```bash\ndotnet user-secrets sync-template\n```\n\n\nThis would generate an output like:\n```json\n{\n  \"ConnectionStrings\": {\n    \"Default\": \"\u003cTO_BE_PROVIDED\u003e\"\n  },\n  \"Jwt\": {\n    \"Issuer\": \"\u003cTO_BE_PROVIDED\u003e\",\n    \"Key\": \"\u003cTO_BE_PROVIDED\u003e\"\n  }\n}\n``` \n\n\n\n🔒 Keeps secrets safe (no values exposed)\n\n📦 Provides a standardized, sharable template\n\n👥 Improves team collaboration and onboarding\n\n🚀 Helps CI/CD environments understand required config keys\n\n✅ Mirrors common .env.example practice found in Node.js and other ecosystems\n\nAlternatives Considered\nManually documenting keys in README\n\nUsing a fake appsettings.Development.json with dummy values (risky if accidentally committed)\n\nWriting custom scripts to parse secrets.json\n\n\n",

E.g., {ProjectName}_{DocumentName}.json.\n\nThere is an option to set the filename:\n```xml\n\u003cPropertyGroup\u003e\n  \u003cOpenApiGenerateDocumentsOptions\u003e--file-name my-open-api\u003c/OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOptions\u003e\n\u003c/PropertyGroup\u003e\n```\n\nBut this does not set the filename, only the project name prefix. If your document name is not `v1`, the `--file-name` parameters only sets the prefix. My document name, for example is `openapi.json`, using the above, I end up with `my-filename_openapi.json`.\n\nSo if I want to match my OpenAPI endpoint configuration below:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nservices.AddOpenApi(\"openapi\");\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\napp.MapOpenApi(\"/{documentName}.json\");\n\napp.Run();\n```\n\nThere\u0027s simply no way and requires me to run a post-build script to rename the output file.",

The output of the hot reload windows will begin to classify the web api project as a Web Assembly project and it will break hot reload for the web assembly / server / interactive host project and the web api project.  \n\nhttps://github.com/chenegathoffman/hot-reload-is-broken/commits/master/\n\nBefore moving the record to the .client project.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1304\" height=\"392\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76e5e73c-1c86-4101-9cfd-1358afccca5e\" /\u003e\n\nAfter moving the record to the .client project.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1077\" height=\"577\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a815c48-4397-4d11-8c8f-a783c95ac276\" /\u003e\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect that the Web Api project to continue to be classified as a (Web Server) project.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nCreate new blazor interactive project.  Add a new web api project (minimal api template is fine).  Add a reference to the .client project in the web api project.  Set the solution to start up the blazor host and the web api project.  Make a change to the weather forecast api endpoint and observe that it hot reloads.  Move the WeatherForecast record into the .client project.  Run the solution again, make the change to the web api and hot reload will break because it classifies the web api project as a Web Assembly project.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version\n\n.net core 9\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",
