This is because we don\u0027t have a good way of knowing exactly what is the full subset that needs to be shipped given a specific change or list of packages that we want to service. This means that if we tried to ship a subset of packages today, there is a risk that we may miss shipping some packages that are transitive dependencies of the packages that we are shipping, templates that need updating, or packages that are referenced by new templates that are being shipped.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track the investigation of what it would take to have good confidence that, given a change that we want to ship and set of packages that we want to service, we\u0027d know the full set of packages that we need to ship from the build, and which ones is okay to not ship. Being able to do this confidently, will increase our agility.\r\n\r\ncc: @DamianEdwards, @RussKie, @radical ",

At the moment all of our testing is done against Docker/Docker Desktop, but we say we support Podman but don\u0027t do any validation in our CI.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @mitchdenny in https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/5628#issuecomment-2345138302_\r\n\r\nAt the moment we allow developers to select between Docker/Docker Desktop and Podman for container runtime support. However in our CI tests we only ever use Docker Desktop and I\u0027d say 90% of our team uses Docker Desktop rather than Podman on a daily basis (the DCP folks probably swap between them a bit more than we do).\r\n\r\nThere are so many issues that we get filed where there are subtle compatibility issues/differences between Docker Desktop and Podman. A lot of these fall into container networking differences and we are making some investments there around setting up container networks (see: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/5628).\r\n\r\nThis issue is more around how we can improve our test coverage for Podman moving forward. I think there are a few problems to solve here:\r\n\r\n1. If we add test coverage for Podman (e.g. switch `[Fact]` to `[Theory]` to swapping container runtimes in tests) then developers will need to have both installed.\r\n2. We will need Podman on build machines/helix agents.\r\n\r\nWe probably don\u0027t need to duplicate tests for both runtimes everywhere, there are probably just some key feature areas that we know need _some_ coverage.",

It would indeed be useful to ensure that our code blocks are well-formed, but I don\u0027t believe that the solution for that should live in this repo.

Thoughts? If you agree, I\u0027m happy to help transfer this issue over.",

Currently, this can more than double the time it takes for an invocation of `./build.cmd` to complete.\n\nWe should consider moving the Playwright directory out of `./artifacts` to something like `./.playwright` in the root of the repo instead.\n\nAlternatively we might consider:\n\n- Setting the `InstallBrowsersForPlaywright` property to false for command line builds by default\n- Moving the `ProvisionBrowsersForPlaywright` target to run during test rather than build (either continuing as a target or instead move the logic into a test fixture)\n\nRelated files:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/fc37ee8a5bca9c899ed98afa6ebb15f45062c610/tests/Directory.Build.props#L13\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/fc37ee8a5bca9c899ed98afa6ebb15f45062c610/tests/Shared/Playwright/Playwright.targets#L23",

Make all of the integrations top level in the Integrations folder, both client and hosting integration live side by side.\n2. Try to group integrations by the integration software (e.g. kafka) src/Integrations/Kafka/Aspire.Hosting.Kafka, src/Integrations/Kafka/Aspire.Confluent.Kafka.\n3. More options that I haven\u0027t thought about.\n\nIt would also be a chance to figure out if we should move the tests as well.

Use github actions/cache to download the playwright dependencies once, and cache them.\n\n## Downloading the dependencies\n\n- Use `dotnet` with the build command `build tests/Aspire.Dashboard.Tests/Aspire.Dashboard.Tests.csproj /p:InstallBrowsersForPlaywright=true` to install the dependencies.\n- After that you can cache the contents of `artifacts/bin/playwright-deps/`.\n- This whole thing needs to be done once per OS - macos, ubuntu, and windows\n\n## Cache\n\n- Use the cache key to be unique for each day. This is because we can\u0027t easily figure out the browser versions, and these don\u0027t change often enough.\n- Restore the dependencies to the original location when executing `run-tests.yml` github workflow\n- And pass `/p:InstallBrowsersForPlaywright=false` when building the test project in the `run-tests.yml` workflow.",

        "body":  "Currently the Copilot setup steps does a full build, with `PrepareForHelix=true`. This is done because the Copilot agent has restricted access to the network causing builds to fail with nuget restore failures for example. The setup step takes 4-5mins, making the whole thing slower. But it isn\u0027t needed every time.\n\nInstead, we could either:\n\n1. Use https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/customizing-or-disabling-the-firewall-for-copilot-coding-agent to add the known good hosts for nugets, and dependencies to the allow lists, which would allow Copilot to build as needed.\n\n2. Ensure that we restore all the dependencies for the build, and the tests.\n    - The template tests are special here because they use isolated nuget caches which would then need to be pre-populated .. which could be a little messy.\n\nIf (1) sounds OK, then we should opt for that IMHO.\ncc @danmoseley @joperezr ",

When a test job in the Tests workflow fails, the yml generates a test summary in markdown format. Post this summary to the new Github Check also.\n2. Post the summaries as the various test jobs fail.\n\nReferences that would be useful for this:\n- https://www.kenmuse.com/blog/creating-github-checks/\n- https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/using-the-rest-api-to-interact-with-checks?apiVersion=2022-11-28\n\nAsk questions as needed to clarify what is needed here.\n\n## Validation\n\nIntroduce artificial failures in at least two tests in different test projects.

Anyway, I\u0027m fine with disabling the warning for now.\n\nMaybe different versions of the .NET 10 SDK there was a change for preview7 https://github.com/NuGet/Home/pull/14442 if any of you ran nightlies then (or different branch/commit checked out? No lockfile used? Non-deterministic build?). I\u0027d expect the warning to be legit and the ref should be removed, otherwise the false positive should be reported in the NuGet/Home repo.\n\nSeems like a good time to try and remove it now that 9.4 just shipped (congrats on that! 🎉)",

For the `linux` variants put the binary in a top level directory called `aspire`. Don\u0027t do this for others.\n\n2. Adjust the scripts that download these archives namely `eng/scripts/get-aspire-cli.sh` and `eng/scripts/get-aspire-cli.ps1` to handle this special case.\n\n### Other useful information\n\n- The build can be tested by running the build script with `/p:SkipManagedBuild=true`. And this would result in all the archives like `aspire-cli-osx-arm64*`.\n\n### Validating\n\n- Check the generated archive to ensure the binary is in a top-level folder on linux. But is in the root for others.\n- Ask for the azure internal pipeline to be run, to validate whether this works. And iterate with the user till this is producing the correct results. You cannot run this directly.\n\n- Ensure that the download scripts correctly install the `aspire` binary in to the install folder on linux (eg. `~/.aspire/bin`).\n\n",
