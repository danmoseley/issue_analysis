ACA thinks the app failed to start.\n\nLocally, you see “Finished” because you ran the container manually (e.g. docker run … \u0026\u0026 exit). No  probe blocks you.\n\nThe recommended solution is to convert to a `ContainerApp Job` \nSince your DB‐schema‐manager is truly “run‑to‑completion,” the easiest path is to re‐deploy it as a Job instead of a long‑running App. Jobs in ACA spin up pods, let them finish, and then mark themselves “Succeeded” (no probe blocking).\n\nI’d like to note that the Aspire dashboard currently only shows Container Apps; adding support for Container App Jobs is on our backlog.",

The environment was called padel-app. I\u0027ve deleted it several times and re-created it a few times (mostly for the sake of costs) and eventually it didn\u0027twork anymore. I\u0027ve just created a completly new environment (padel-app-v2, because why not) and it works like a charm. I think you should look for some components or whatever that should be deleted but actually aren\u0027t. Quite possibly corrupted data.",

In this case, the re-creation provisions a new cluster, while the old AKS cluster associated with the original environment has already been deleted.\n\nWhen the Aspire dashboard URL is accessed during this window, it attempts to authenticate against the old cluster. Since that cluster no longer exists, the authentication fails, resulting in the “internal server error”.\n\nThis is effectively a race condition during environment deletion and re-creation. I’ll go ahead and flag this as a bug, since the expected behavior should not result in failed authentication when re-using environment names.\n\nTemporary workaround: Until a fix is in place, we recommend creating environments with a new unique name instead of re-using the name of a recently deleted environment. This avoids the race condition and ensures the Aspire dashboard works as expected.",
