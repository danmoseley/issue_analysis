This sounds like it could reduce needless boilerplate, and would be inline with how minimal APIs function in aspnetcore.\n\nThat said, I have another proposition. How about being able to group annotations together.\n\n```cs\nvar internalService = builder.AddProject\u003c[...];\nvar applicationInsights = builder.[...];\n\nvar backendStuff = builder.CreateComposable(internalService, applicationInsights);\n\nvar backendOne = builder.Add[...]\n    .WithReference(backendStuff);\n\n// The former is equivalent to: \nvar backendOne = builder.Add[...]\n    .WithReference(applicationInsights)\n    .WithReference(internalService);\n\n```\n\nThis would solve the problem, but would also allow resources to be apart of multiple \"groups\", which the actual group proposal wouldn\u0027t really",

This is something simple that you could do today with our existing APIs:\n\n```\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();\n\nvar p1 = builder.AddProject\u003cP1\u003e()\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"1\") ;\n\nvar p2 = builder.AddProject\u003cP2\u003e()\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"2\") ;\n\nvar p3 = builder.AddProject\u003cP3\u003e()\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"3\") ;\n\nAddImportantFooStuff([p1, p2, p3]);\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n\npublic static void AddImportantFooStuff(params IResourceWithEnvironment[] resources)\n{\n  foreach (var resource in resources)\n  {\n    resource.WithEnvironment(\"shared\", \"shared value\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nGrouping implies hierarchy in application of environment variables which isn\u0027t always what you want. Further what happens with dynamically injected child resources - do they get placed into the group as well? Do they get the environment variables?\n\nI think we should avoid this for now. I think it would be useful to add a tagging mechanism to the app model where you can do this:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();\n\nvar p1 = builder.AddProject\u003cP1\u003e()\n       .WithTag(\"x\")\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"1\") ;\n\nvar p2 = builder.AddProject\u003cP2\u003e()\n       .WithTag(\"x\")\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"2\") ;\n\nvar p3 = builder.AddProject\u003cP3\u003e()\n       .WithTag(\"y\")\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"3\") ;\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nThen you could optionally do something like this:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder();\n\nvar p1 = builder.AddProject\u003cP1\u003e()\n       .WithTag(\"x\")\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"1\") ;\n\nvar p2 = builder.AddProject\u003cP2\u003e()\n       .WithTag(\"x\")\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"2\") ;\n\nvar p3 = builder.AddProject\u003cP3\u003e()\n       .WithTag(\"y\")\n       .WithEnvironment(\"unique\", \"3\") ;\n\nbuilder.Eventing.Subscribe\u003cBeforeResourceStart\u003e((e, ct) =\u003e {\n  if (e.Resource.HasTag(\"x\"))\n  {\n    // Do whatever to mutate resource.\n  }\n});\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```",

        "body":  "Currently the `IServiceMetadata` implementations that are created within the `Projects` namespace are discovered and compiled using the following MSBuild target:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/12af412b50c7533a75748edae2776d70a64c890e/src/Aspire.Hosting/build/Aspire.Hosting.targets#L15-L64\r\n\r\nI\u0027m proposing that you consider creating and using a Roslyn Analyzer (Source generator) instead. When I first explored this generated `IServiceMetadata` implementation I was surprised to see that I could edit the file, which wouldn\u0027t be the case with a source generated file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to propose that instead of replacing `.` and `-` with `_`, that you simply remove them instead. For example, consider the following differences in these two approaches:\r\n\r\n- `AspireSample.Web` would be `AspireSampleWeb` instead of `AspireSample_Web`.\r\n- `AspireSample.ApiService` would be `AspireSampleApiService` instead of `AspireSample_ApiService`.\r\n\r\nThis feels a bit more idiomatic.",

Does the \"sidecar\" need to be a container, or can it be an OS process too?

For sidecar containers, I think that this is something that is fairly common amongst orchestrators with some question marks over container lifetime (e.g. init containers etc).\r\n\r\nVolume mounts is more problematic. Once you get to the cloud hosting providers there isn\u0027t really a viable way to use a host path as a volume mount, so you need to consider what volume mounting solutions the storage system for your particular compute platform supports. For this reason, it might make sense to model out the concept of a volume as a first-class resource type - in ACA it could be provisioned as an Azure Storage Files endpoint which is then mounted into the ACA deployed container (this would just be down to the way that AZD interprets a volume resource).\r\n\r\nAnother angle on this problem is what is the initial content of the volume mount. A lot of people will use volume mounts to inject configuration which cannot be done via simple environment variables. Prometheus is a pretty good example of this, as is Grafana. For these scenarios it might be better for folks to inject these configs via building a customized container.\r\n\r\nHow we handle staging loose files from the build directory into a volume mount is another challenge. Different IaC solutions support this to varying degrees. Using Bicep for example it is possible to load a text file into memory and then set that to the content of a blob by using a deployment script resource ... but it is wildly inefficient and there are size constraints.",

I agree that both \"sidecar container\" and \"volume mount\" concepts make sense, but I am wondering if it makes sense to raise the abstraction level a notch in the CAM. \r\n\r\nFor example, we could have \"multi-project service\" object type, and its instances would be deployed as multi-container apps to ACA and pods to Kubernetes. In the local dev environment we might not need to do anything different for multi-project services because all projects share the same OS environment.\r\n\r\nFor volume mounts my inclination is to treat \"configuration via files\" vs \"scratchpad filesystem\" as different use cases/different model entities. Wiktor\u0027s case is the scratchpad filesystem one. The CAM could have a type for it, and in the ACA environment it would result in a volume, plus volume mount for each container that consumes it. In the local dev environment a scratchpad filesystem instance would be rendered as a temporary folder (allocated by DCP). The mount path might be a bit tricky to keep uniform between the  ACA/K8s case and the local dev case because it is not always easy (and potentially conflicting) to create a link at the root of the filesystem as in Wiktor\u0027s example. We could mitigate this by using extra level of indirection via env. vars (i.e. the scratchpad filesystem path would not be well-known but instead provided via an environment variable). One wishes cgroups/namespaces was an universal OS concept ☺️ ",

What does that mean exactly?\r\n\r\nfirstly, happy new year @davidfowl and team; hope you all had a good holiday period.\r\nand apologies for the cryptic description above.\r\n\r\nWe have a number guiding principles from our security and infrastructure teams; that we are required to follow when designing application/system architecture.  These principles are all around the topic of secure by design; and state we should separating application from it\u0027s services (not owned by the application its self) at a network layer especially common/shared services like caching/messaging/database.  The separation may be provided by the network via vlan routing, firewall or reverse-proxy allowing traffic between groups of services by port mappings.\r\n\r\nTo support the secure by design mandated by our security \u0026 infrastructure teams have tooling that is used map network designs (visual) or reverse engineer (into artifacts) like powershell DSC which are used to check the networks/volumes etc. and alert or revert changes if any unauthorised change is detected.\r\n\r\nI understand as part of the teams tooling k8, nginx, v-sphere, hyper-v is supported.\r\n\r\nIf aspire supported network configurations this would allow the continued tooling to work; I also understand that the teams for a number of customer account use Azure Arc in a multi-tenanted type scenario where a tenant is a department of the larger customer account.\r\n\r\nI hope that give you a better understanding of where and why aspire network configuration would/could help.  I\u0027d be happy to outline more if needed via DM\r\n\r\n",

If you go directly through the docker network, then you circumvent the networking of our orchestrator which means it isn\u0027t modeled and doesn\u0027t show up anywhere. Projects don\u0027t run as containers so you can\u0027t attach projects to a container network. Right now, container to container networking is via the host and the orchestrator (dcp) manages proxies to make things like replicas work (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/networking-overview for more details). Service discovery might just work but we haven\u0027t considered what it means to build the end to end such that if you turned your project into a container and added it to the app model that service discovery would continue to work as is (the follow on implications of those changes etc).\r\n\r\nI think we will need to support this, but there has to be experimentation in how to expose this in the app model. I believe there\u0027s support for it in the underlying orchestrator, but it\u0027s not exposed.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: We want to do this, but have decided this isn\u0027t a priority for GA so no time has been spent exploring or fleshing out potential solutions.",

Or do we want to have a fully fletched network resource that we put in the manifest which deployment tools then need to interpret.\r\n\r\nI think we are going to run into a translation problem between the network topology that we can represent in Aspire locally and what the deployment tools can represent.\r\n\r\nFor example, lets say that we want to have multiple Docker networks defined and used in a single Aspire. API TBD, but it might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar net1 = builder.AddNetwork(\"net1\");\r\nvar net2 = builder.AddNetwork(\"net2\");\r\n\r\nvar app1 = builder.AddContainer(\"app1\", \"image1\")\r\n                  .AttachTo(net1);\r\n\r\nvar app2 = builder.AddContainer(\"app2\", \"image2\")\r\n                  .AttachTo(net1)\r\n                  .AttachTo(net2);\r\n\r\nvar app2 = builder.AddContainer(\"app3\", \"image3\")\r\n                  .AttachTo(net2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would result in DCP creating two networks, and when we attach the containers to them. But what is the benefit here for local development?\r\n\r\nThe above is also problematic for deployment scenarios because target deployment environments won\u0027t always be able to faithfully represent a complex network topology like this. For example when we deploy with AZD we deploy all the containers on the same container app environment. Would using networks cause us to create multiple container app environments to ensure network isolation?\r\n\r\n... we couldn\u0027t represent a container being on two networks so I guess that would have to be an error.\r\n\r\n",

We use an external docker-compose network so that our docker-compose files that are specific to each of our services that reside in individual service-specific repositories can all communicate to each other. \r\n\r\nMigration for us from `docker-compose` to Aspire would require the ability to spin up containers in Aspire with the ability to overload the network until we have all of our services on Aspire, only then could we switch to a theoretical \"global\" Aspire docker network.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027re very interested in Aspire as it\u0027d give us much easier control over how we spin up our services locally for development purposes.\r\n",

        "body":  "The .NET Aspire ServiceDefaults project defaults to configuring health check endpoints for service projects. Similarly, .NET Aspire components default to registering health checks for the dependencies they integrate with. Currently, the status of these health checks is not visible anywhere by default. We should consider adding UI to the dashboard (add potentially [concepts to the AppHost app model](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/890)) to display the status of resources\u0027 health checks.\r\n\r\nI can imagine a few click-stops:\r\n\r\n1. Show last known status of health check endpoints, i.e. healthy, degraded, unhealthy, at a glance, perhaps on the relevant resources summary page, e.g. a column with a status indicator icon on the projects page. The interval the health check endpoints are inspected would default to something reasonable (e.g. 10 seconds) and perhaps be configurable either in the dashboard UI and/or in the AppHost app model.\r\n2. Tracking of health check status changes over time, so that in addition to the last status, a history of status requests and their result could be viewed, e.g. clicking on the last known status indicator in the summary would open a view that shows the history of all status checks.\r\n3. A detailed view of all the individual health checks that contribute to the overall status reported for a given health checks endpoint (similar to https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks#HealthCheckUI, perhaps we consider how we might just integrate that given that we\u0027re already depending on the individual health checks from this project from the relevant Aspire component packages)",

This approach would enable the re-utilization of the existing Metrics UI built for visualizing metrics (hence address point 3) and it benefit the whole eco-system as these health checks can then be utilized by any tool which implements OTEL metrics.",

A scenario that I\u0027ve been playing with is creating a reusable component that allows you to easily receiver webhook notifications from GitHub and forward them to an Azure Storage queue. The container with the actual application logic would be hosted in Docker Hub, and there would be a NuGet package containing extension methods for wiring it up. This is what the usage would look like in a consuming application.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar secret = builder.AddSecretStore(\"mysecrets\").AddSecret(\"webhooksharedsecret\");\r\nvar queues = builder.AddAzureStorage(\"azstorage\").AddQueue(\"azqueues\");\r\nvar webhookReceiver = builder.AddGitHubWebhookReceiver(\"webhookreceiver\", secret, queues);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the developer building this extension they want to be able to just have an Aspire host that they can run in their own repo that allows them to spin up their web app. Having an API like `AddProjectContainer\u003cT\u003e(...)` would allow for this scenario:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e AddGitHubWebhookReceiver(this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder, string name, IResourceBuilder\u003cSecretResource\u003e secret, IResourceBuilder\u003cAzureQueueStorageResource\u003e queues)\r\n{\r\n  #if DEBUG\r\n    return AddProjectContainer(...);\r\n  #endif\r\n\r\n   #if !DEBUG\r\n    return AddContainer(...);\r\n   #endif\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt allows the return type to always be a container, even though in the home repo for the Aspire extension you can build from project sources and attach debuggers etc. AddProjectContainer(...) might rely on something with launch profiles to make this work as you\u0027ve suggested though.",

We would need to some kind of standardized mechanism so components can opt into this behavior (e.g. IResourceSupportsContainer ... terrible name but you get the point).\r\n\r\nThere is also a question of what happens to the resource that is in the app model already. Does AsContainerInLocalDev remove it from the app model and replace it with the container resource.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you end up with code like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar postgres = builder.AddPostgres(\"catalogdb\");\r\nvar app = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Frontend\u003e(...)\r\n    .WithReference(postgres);\r\npostgres.AsContainerInLocalDev(container =\u003e container\r\n        .WithDataVolume()\r\n        .WithInitDb(\"../data/scripts/catalogdb\")\r\n        .WithEnvironment(\"POSTGRES_DB\", \"AppDb\")\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would probably break a bunch of callbacks. I think what we\u0027d probably end up having to do here is have a shim resource type like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class PostgresContainerResource(PostgresServerResource innerResource) : ContainerResource(innerResource.Name)\r\n{\r\n   // Redirect Annotations to inner resource.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way all the APIs you want for container like things are there, but you are really just leveraging the fact that its the annotations that really drive all the behavior.",

        "body":  "Right now, when you run the host, it runs everything and debug works fine.\r\n\r\nPart 1:\r\n\r\nMost of the time however, what you really want is for the services to just run without any debugger, and then be able to quickly attach. Right now VS Code and VS.net have a pretty horrible UX for attaching a debugger. It would be nice for the Aspire team to work with VS.net and VS Code teams to make this a right click, \"attach\" function.  I.e. because you know all about the path to the executable of the service from the csproj, you should be able to find the running process and attach in one click without having to search through the endless dialog that pops up.\r\n\r\nSo I\u0027d like to be able to tell the Aspire Host to just run the, not debug them, and then be able to attach a debugger to one or more as necessary.\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nI\u0027d like to be able to create targets that orchestrate based on the one that was run, what the ultimate session purpose was for. I.e. if you are working on a website, you need all of your backend running and the website.  This is how it is now. And that\u0027s great.\r\n\r\nBut there is also \"I want to debug a job\". I want to be able to define and orchestrate that job and all it\u0027s dependencies and have it show up in the host and deployment information, but I don\u0027t want it running at all, nor debugging unless I say I want to run that target explicitly. (i.e. typically this would be like redis cache, database, and then the project for the job)\r\n\r\nI would rather not have multiple hosts just for this purpose, and by defining some sort of command line ability to specify the target, you could have different run profiles and if you could set it in the launchSettings.json of the host project, then VS.net and VS Code could pick those up and offer them as targets.\r\n\r\nThis would give us the excellent dashboard and give us jobs that are dependent on micro services to run in one click, which really isn\u0027t possible unless you want to risk that job running when it shouldn\u0027t be.\r\n\r\nThis also works better for wanting to target a debug session to a specific web property,. So if you have say a public portal and an admin, you only want to debug the portal, but you want it all defined in the host, and you want to just run the host, which will start up all of the micro services that you have to have going etc. and that website but only that website.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the AddProject (Call it AddProjectEndpoint or something) functionality could be refined to actually only launch if the target or anythin with references to that are the target.  This would provide a really simple way of building this out.\r\n\r\nAnd by doing this, then the generate manifest has everything as well which isn\u0027t possible right now because of these issues right now.",

At this time, the Dapr sidecar has been started and requires the RabbitMQ service. However, because the service cannot be found, the Dapr sidecar stops working and there is nothing to set. Try the restart strategy, and then although RabbitMQ has started successfully, Dapr becomes dead.\r\n\r\nWish there was an option to automatically try to restart after failure, so that would solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThe container can be restarted after failure through startup parameter settings, but I don\u0027t want to containerize the Dapr sidecar, so there is no option to restart.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nsidecarBuilder.WithRestartAlways()\r\n.WithRestartAlways(10) // 10 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully something like this setup.\r\n",

Since we don\u0027t have startup dependencies, we need a way to restart on fail when containers need to connect to each other, and we are unable to control retries inside of that container.\r\n\r\nWe have also seen cases when a container starts successfully and fairly quickly, but then takes 10+ seconds to actually start responding to requests. So the startup dependencies would not help in that case.\r\n\r\nBest solution is to make the client robust (retry connections with exponential backoff). Second best is to retry the failed containers/executables a few times before giving up, which is what this feature is about.",

This doesn\u0027t allow me to set env. variables or anything like that, but it does allow me to see the logs and start (not stop 😆 ) resources. This system is very flaky and at least one of the resources fails to start every time I start up Aspire, so being able to add say a `.WithRetries(5)` to all of these resouces would be great.\n\nYes, it would be a hack to get a hack running smoother, but if I encountered this situation I\u0027m sure others would too.",

The AddProject/AddContainer/AddExecutable methods are checking for duplicate names but it\u0027s possible to add resources directly to the app model collection. There is duplicate validation in the `Build()` method to check again for duplicates.\r\n\r\nThe same issue exists with endpoints on a resource.

There is validation in builder methods, but it\u0027s still possible to add a duplicate endpoint directly to the annotation.\r\n\r\nThere are also annotations that should have a maximum of one instance, e.g. `ManifestPublishingCallbackAnnotation`.",

For projects and containers, that includes endpoints, environment variables and arguments. The complexity here is that we want to preserve the object references so that we can have different behavior depending on the context. A `ReferenceExpression` is this object that lets you represent a formatted string that preserves the live object references. When you set this in the env, or args or anywhere else its supported, we can do interesting things like translate those object references into an IaC format (our manifest being one version of this).\r\n\r\n\u003e I didn\u0027t like that I had to replicate the logic of the protected PostgresServerResource.UserNameReference property and copy the value of the private PostgresServerResource.DefaultUserName field.\r\n\r\nThese are the growing pains of a v1 framework.

This workaround means the manifest indicates the string `host.docker.internal` instead of the reference to the pg host. Why was the workaround needed? If the `ReferenceExpression` to the pg host is used, it resolves to `localhost` which doesn\u0027t work with the container\u0027s networking model. \r\n\r\nThis got me wondering how this problem is handled in Aspire. How do the connection strings in containers end up using `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` while still outputting the correct manifest contents? Here is how the default connection string is constructed in `PostgresServerResource`:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate ReferenceExpression ConnectionString =\u003e\r\n\tReferenceExpression.Create($\"Host={PrimaryEndpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Host)};Port={PrimaryEndpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port)};Username={UserNameReference};Password={PasswordParameter}\");\r\n```\r\nNotice how it does use the reference expression for the host instead of the string literal. This is what we would want in an ideal world. Could it be that when the `ReferenceExpression` is resolved that the consumer of the connection string can be specified thus altering the output accordingly? No, it turns out the connection string still resolves to `localhost` even when the consumer intends it for a container.\r\n\r\nDCP\u0027s `ApplicationExecutor.GetValue` contains the answer. It does a `string.Replace` on the connection string:\r\n```C#\r\nif (value is not null \u0026\u0026 isContainer \u0026\u0026 valueProvider is ConnectionStringReference or EndpointReference or HostUrl)\r\n{\r\n    // If the value is a connection string or endpoint reference, we need to replace localhost with the container host.\r\n    return ReplaceLocalhostWithContainerHost(value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe if check ends up explaining why our `getConnectionUrl` method ends up being `localhost` while the built in connection string ends up being `host.docker.internal`. The traditional `WithReference` constructs a `ConnectionStringReference` while the `getConnectionUrl` is providing a plain old `ReferenceExpression`.\r\n\r\nA couple solutions off the top of my head would be overloading `ConnectionStringReference` or creating a new type, but those are very small picture solutions.",

Then there is `ConfigurePostgreSqlInfrastructure` in `AzurePostgresExtension.cs` that will just merrily write various connection strings to the keyvault and deployment output directly without any way to customize them. It is therefore not possible to override the connection strings in a way that would also work in deployment at all (unless we start brute forcing stuff with reflection).\n\nEven if this was solved, there will still only be a single connection string available, so using a uri-style connection string with one application while using the parameter-style with another would not work.\n\nIt seems to me that the design decision that a resource can have one or zero connection strings is bringing all these troubles. I see connection strings as are more or less an abstraction of endpoints as they are used in aspire right now, meaning a connection string is an interpolated value that has a format (in the form of an interpolation string so it can be deployed as a bicep value or evaluated at runtime), it has a name and maybe some annotations/meta information, for example whether it should be published to keyvault. Then, an endpoint is just a more specialized connection string with the uri format.\n\nThis would allow to override or add connection strings as annotations on a resource, for example:\n\n```\nvar timeout = builder.AddParameter(\"timeout\");\n\nvar db = builder.AddPostgres(\"pg\")\n    .AddDatabase(\"db\")\n    // add a named connection string as annotation\n    .WithConnectionString(\"withtimeout\", ctx =\u003e ReferenceExpression.Create($\"Host={ctx.FullyQualifiedDomainName};Username={ctx.AdministratorLogin};Password={ctx.AdministratorLoginPassword};Database={ctx.DatabaseName};Timeout={timeout}\"));\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Api\u003e(\"api\")\n    .WithReference(db, \"withtimeout\")\n    .WaitFor(db);\n```\n\nThe `WithConnectionString` method would provide the context object with all relevant properties from the current (and parent) resource as `ReferenceExpression`, this would additionally make it possible to use values from other places, as the example with the timeout parameter shows. A connection string annotation without a name would be treated as the default connection string.\n\n**edit:** used ReferenceExpression.Create instead of BicepFunction.Interpolate as per @davidfowl ",

InnerResource { get; private set; }\ninternal ParameterResource? UserNameParameter { get; set; }\ninternal ParameterResource? PasswordParameter { get; set; }\n```\nSo I can\u0027t access the InnerResource, which is the container if I use RunAsContainer. I can\u0027t access UserName or Password parameters, so I have to get them from outside.\n\nin https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/4cf659537878bd70bcc5035bcd82126ef467ade2/src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.PostgreSQL/AzurePostgresExtensions.cs#L427 \n\n`var postgres = CreatePostgreSqlFlexibleServer(infrastructure, distributedApplicationBuilder, azureResource.Databases);`\n\nwhich is then used for the connection strings:\n\n`Value = BicepFunction.Interpolate($\"Host={postgres.FullyQualifiedDomainName};[...]`\n\nso now I have to go on the hunt for the ProvisioningResource and PostgresServerResource and my code looks like this:\n\n```\nvar postgresUser = builder.AddParameter(\"postgresUser\", \"postgres\", true);\nvar postgresPassword = builder.AddResource(ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.CreateDefaultPasswordParameter(builder, \"postgresPassword\")); // there\u0027s probably a nicer way to do this, haven\u0027t found it yet\n\nPostgreSqlFlexibleServer? flexibleServer = null;\nPostgresServerResource? postgresServer = null;\n\nvar postgres = builder.AddAzurePostgresFlexibleServer(\"postgres\")\n  .WithPasswordAuthentication(postgresUser, postgresPassword)\n  .ConfigureInfrastructure(infra =\u003e\n    {\n      flexibleServer = infra.GetProvisionableResources()\n                                .OfType\u003cPostgreSqlFlexibleServer\u003e()\n                                .Single();\n    }).RunAsContainer(cfg =\u003e\n  {\n    postgresServer = cfg.Resource;\n    cfg.WithUserName(postgresUser);\n    cfg.WithPassword(postgresPassword);\n  });\n\nvar postgresdb = postgres.AddDatabase(\"postgresdb\");\n\nvar pgConn = builder.AddConnectionString(\"pgconn\", postgresServer is null\n? ReferenceExpression.Create($\"postgres://{postgresUser}:{postgresPassword}@{flexibleServer.FullyQualifiedDomainName}/{postgresdb.Resource.Name}\")\n: ReferenceExpression.Create($\"postgres://{postgresUser}:{postgresPassword}@{postgres.Resource.Name}:{postgresServer!.GetEndpoint(\"tcp\").Port.ToString()}/{postgresdb.Resource.Name}\"));\n```\n\nonly that `flexibleServer.FullyQualifiedDomainName` is a bicep value and can\u0027t be used in a ReferenceExpression. So now I have to reverse engineer or somehow hardcode the naming scheme. The endpoint of the postgresServer is also not created at this point so I can\u0027t access the port here and there is no ReferenceExpression I\u0027ve found to just get the port.",

For ACA is the min or max?\n\nI do very much think that `WithReplicas` should allow a min/max. At the end of the day it should be up to the deployment integration/environment on what to do with that including whether or not to ignore it. But sticking with ACA it would be helpful to say hey we want no more than 1... or we only want a max of X. In all likelihood you probably don\u0027t need to care about it for development time... but since this is responsible for ultimately creating a manifest that is used for provisioning/deployment I do think this concept does very much matter.

        "body":  "As part of building out the [HealthChecksUI sample](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/pull/140) and the addition of the `EndpointAnnotation.IsExternal` flag in preview.5, it\u0027s become clear we need to improve how we model a resource\u0027s endpoints such that another resource can explicitly reference its internal or external endpoint in cases where they differ.\r\n\r\nIn short, we should ensure that external endpoints are explicitly modeled in a consistent manner and our default experiences for resources result in discrete external endpoints being modeled (in addition to the default endpoints) when that resource is marked as external.\r\n\r\nStrawman for proposed changes:\r\n\r\n- Add a new `AsExternal()` extension method to `IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e where T : IResourceWithEndpoints` that creates copies of all the resource\u0027s non-external endpoints but marked as external and named for the original endpoint but with a `-external` suffix. This can be used to easily expose external endpoints for any resource, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    ```csharp\r\n    builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyFrontend\u003e(\"frontend\")\r\n       .WithReference(basketService)\r\n       .WithReference(catalogService)\r\n       .AsExternal();\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Assuming an ASP.NET Core project has a launch profile `\"https\"` with two endpoints defined in its `\"applicationUrl\"` property (one for https, one for http), and the AppHost project was launched using a launch profile named `\"https\"`, the above would result in **four** endpoints being modeled for the project:\r\n\r\n    1. \"https\": `IsExternal = false`\r\n    2. \"http\": `IsExternal = false`\r\n    3. \"https-external\": `IsExternal = true`\r\n    4. \"http-external\": `IsExternal = true`\r\n\r\n- Update the `Dcp.ApplicationExecutor` such that resource endpoints with `IsExternal` and `IsProxied` set to `true` result in DCP launching the proxy configured to listen on the additional port for that \"external\" endpoint, but resolve to the usual target port for the application instance(s), i.e. the proxy terminates all endpoints marked as `IsExternal` and forwards them to the application instance(s) listen port(s).\r\n- Update the `Dcp.ApplicationExecutor` such that the logic for injecting the endpoint port into the application instance(s) is based on whether the `EnivonrmentVariable` property on the endpoint is set and some way for the resource to specialize how the value should be written to the variable. The default would be to group endpoint ports into a semi-colon delimited string for each environment variable specified but the `ProjectResource` would implement the hook (interface or annotation) to specify it wants the full endpoint URL written via a semi-colon delimited list if the environment variable is `ASPNETCORE_URLS`. The goal here is to remove all the custom logic in `ApplicationExecutor` for how the endpoint details are written into the environment variables.\r\n- Consider updating `EndpointReference` and adding convenience methods to allow easily retrieving the desired external endpoint for a resource, e.g. `GetExternalEndpoint(string name)` which will look for an endpoint where `(Name == name || Name == `$\"{name}-external\") \u0026\u0026 IsExternal == true`.\r\n  - ❓ Should there be a concept of getting the \"default\" endpoint so that I can simply ask for a resource\u0027s default endpoint without needing to know its name? Maybe just `GetExternalEndpoints()` and `GetEndpoints()` that returns an `IEnumerable\u003cEndpointReference\u003e` would be enough, along with `WithReference(IEnumerable\u003cEndpointReference\u003e endpoints)`, then one could do `.WithReference(frontend.GetExternalEndpoints())`\r\n- Update `WithReference(IResourceBuilder\u003cIResourceWithEndpoints\u003e resource)` to use only the non-external endpoints of the passed resource. Resources wishing to reference another resource\u0027s external endpoint will need to pass the `EndpointReference` of the external endpoint explicitly (see suggestion for `GeExternalndpoint` above), e.g.:\r\n\r\n    ```csharp\r\n        builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyFrontend\u003e(\"frontend\")\r\n           .WithReference(basketService)\r\n           .WithReference(catalogService)\r\n           .AsExternal();\r\n\r\n        builder.AddAvailabilityChecker(\"availabilitychecker\")\r\n            .WithReference(frontend.GetExternalEndpoint(\"http\")); // See point above about whether we should introduce concept of \"default\" endpoint so names don\u0027t have to be hard-coded like this\r\n    ```\r\n- ❓ Are any updates to manifest writing for endpoints needed (and by extension AZD)? e.g. how to make AZD understand that a reference to `{frontend.bindings.http-external.url}` means the externally resolvable FQDN assigned by ACA needs to be used?\r\n  - I hit a couple of issues in AZD when building out the sample:\r\n    -  When trying to set the environment variable of a resource to just the `host` portion of another resource\u0027s endpoint, e.g. the manifest contained `\"env\": { \"AllowedHosts\": \"{apiservice.bindings.http.host};{apiservice.bindings.https.host}\" ... `, this resulted in the environment variable being set to just `\"apiservice;apiservice\"` rather than the full internal hostname from the binding URL.\r\n    - For a container resource that had environment variable expressions that referenced other resources, it looked like AZD\u0027s own yaml templating syntax was being written into the `resources.bicep` file that\u0027s used to deploy the container resource, which resulted in that expression not being processed and just being directly to the ACA app environment variables config.\r\n\r\nRelated #2099",

To properly escape any string in a DbConnectionString, we would need to add single quotes `\u0027` around the value, and then escape any real single quotes in the value by doubling them: `\u0027\u0027`.\r\n\r\nSo at a minimum we would need 2 strategies: URI escaping and single-quote escaping.\r\n\r\nAs you pointed out above, we would need to put this in the manifest and have any deployment tools (like `azd`) understand these strategies.\r\n\r\ncc @davidfowl @mitchdenny @ellismg @vhvb1989 ",

Today aspire has [a model](https://gist.github.com/davidfowl/b408af870d4b5b54a28bf18bffa127e1) represented with C# code and resources may translate that model into something like a manifest (what is used today for azd and aspirate), docker compose file, or bicep, or cloud formation etc. \n\nThe current assumption is that values (see the value references in the doc) are lazy and translate into external parameters when doing the translation. As an example, if you need to translate an aspire parameter to bicep there\u0027s a mapping stored to understand how the model in C# maps to bicep parameters and the runtime can fill those in when executing.\n\nWhen publishing it\u0027s more difficult. Take this example:\n\nLowercase the input parameter.\n\n```C#\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar param = builder.AddParameter(\"param1\");\nvar project = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Api\u003e(\"project1\")\n                     .WithEnvironment(\"ParamLower\", param.Resource.Value.ToLowerInvariant());\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nThis looks simple, but it assumes you can do this all in C#. This may work in run mode, and you\u0027ll be able to see the transformation on the input parameter in the \"ParamLower\" environment variable at runtime. When we translate this into the manifest or any other publishing target, we don\u0027t have the value, nor can we lowercase it, we need to store that somewhere.\n\nI see some ways forward here:\n- Support a fixed set of transformations. At a minimum make it possible to express the transformation in an inspectable way (there are multiple ways to do this).\n- Do \"client side evaluation\" this requires a runtime before launching various deployment engines/runtimes parameter filling.",

        "body":  "The AspireWithNode sample is failing after updating to preview.5 due to Node.js\u0027 internal `fetch()` stack rejecting self-signed certificates by default, even if they\u0027re trusted by the host (in this case Windows). I believe this is because Node.js statically links OpenSSL rather than call through the host\u0027s crypto stack.\r\n\r\nSome options to workaround (from Bing Chat) follow. If we wanted to apply one of these automatically in development when `AddNpmApp` or `AddNodeApp` is called, the most specific option appears to be exporting the ASP.NET Core HTTPS dev cert (public key only) and then setting the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable on the Node.js app:\r\n\r\nWhen working with Node.js and making HTTP requests using the **Fetch API**, you might encounter issues related to self-signed certificates. Self-signed certificates are often used for testing purposes or in private intranet services. Here are some approaches to handle self-signed certificates in Node.js:\r\n\r\n1. **Ignoring SSL Verification (Not Recommended)**:\r\n    - You can disable SSL verification altogether by setting the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable to `0`. However, this approach is **not recommended** because it disables SSL verification for all requests, making your application vulnerable to security risks.\r\n    - Example:\r\n        ```javascript\r\n        process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = \"0\";\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n2. **Using a Custom Agent**:\r\n    - Create a custom HTTPS agent with the `rejectUnauthorized` option set to `false`. This approach allows you to selectively ignore SSL verification for specific requests while still validating other certificates.\r\n    - Example:\r\n        ```javascript\r\n        const fetch = require(\u0027node-fetch\u0027);\r\n        const https = require(\u0027https\u0027);\r\n\r\n        const httpsAgent = new https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false });\r\n\r\n        const response = await fetch(url, {\r\n            method: \u0027POST\u0027,\r\n            headers: headers,\r\n            body: body,\r\n            agent: httpsAgent,\r\n        });\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n3. **Monkey Patching the `tls` Module**:\r\n    - You can monkey-patch the `tls` module to support self-signed certificates with custom root certificate authorities (CAs). This approach allows you to append extra root CAs to the default list.\r\n    - Example:\r\n        ```javascript\r\n        const tls = require(\u0027tls\u0027);\r\n        const secureContext = tls.createSecureContext();\r\n        secureContext.context.addCACert(`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\n...`);\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n4. **Using Environment Variables**:\r\n    - Set the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable to the path of a file containing additional root certificates in PEM format. Node.js will add these certificates to its list of hardcoded certificates.\r\n    - Example:\r\n        ```bash\r\n        NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./rootCA.crt node server.js\r\n        ```\r\n\r\nIf you\u0027re testing locally or in a controlled environment, proceed with caution and choose the most appropriate method based on your use case. 🛡️🔒\r\n\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 4/[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67117016/how-can-i-force-fetch-to-accept-a-self-signed-certificate-in-a-web-app-front-end)/[2](https://medium.com/trabe/monkey-patching-tls-in-node-js-to-support-self-signed-certificates-with-custom-root-cas-25c7396dfd2a)024\r\n(1) how can I force fetch to accept a self-signed certificate in a web app .... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67117016/how-can-i-force-fetch-to-accept-a-self-signed-certificate-in-a-web-app-front-end.\r\n(2) Monkey patching tls in node.js to support self-signed certificates with .... https://medium.com/trabe/monkey-patching-tls-in-node-js-to-support-self-signed-certificates-with-custom-root-cas-25c7[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52478069/node-fetch-disable-ssl-verification)96dfd2a.\r\n(3) node.js - Node-fetch: Disable SSL verification - Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52[4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68896243/how-to-properly-configure-node-js-to-use-self-signed-root-certificates)78069/node-fetch-disable-ssl-verification.\r\n(4) How to properly configure node.js to use Self Signed root certificates?. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68896243/how-to-properly-configure-node-js-to-use-self-signed-root-certificates.\r\n(5) Ignore invalid self-signed ssl certificate in node.js with https .... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10888610/ignore-invalid-self-signed-ssl-certificate-in-node-js-with-https-request.\r\n(6) undefined. https://x.x.x.x:8000.\r\n(7) undefined. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1.\r\n(8) Accept self-signed certificates for undici fetch - Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71946885/accept-self-signed-certificates-for-undici-fetch.\r\n(9) Fixing the Custom CA Problem in Node.js — Bossy Lobster. https://blog.bossylobster.com/2021/05/node-ca-append.html.\r\n(10) How to add custom certificate authority (CA) to nodejs. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29283040/how-to-add-custom-certificate-authority-ca-to-nodejs.\r\n(11) GitHub - dhermes/ca-append-js: Monkey-patching Node.js `tls` Module .... https://github.com/dhermes/ca-append-js.\r\n(12) How to disable SSL verification in node.js - Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69596183/how-to-disable-ssl-verification-in-node-js.\r\n(13) How do you disable SSL verification in Fetch? - Technical-QA.com. https://technicqa.com/how-do-you-disable-ssl-verification-in-fetch/.\r\n(14) node.js - How can I ignore SSL/TLS validation using the Fetch API .... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57117388/how-can-i-ignore-ssl-tls-validation-using-the-fetch-api.\r\n(15) How to Add an SSL Certificate to a Node.js Application - MUO. https://www.makeuseof.com/node-js-ssl-certificate-how-add/.\r\n(16) How to Add Self Signed SSL Certificate in Nodejs Server. https://thriveread.com/nodejs-server-self-signed-ssl-certificate/.\r\n(17) How do I use a self signed certificate for a HTTPS Node.js server?. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19665863/how-do-i-use-a-self-signed-certificate-for-a-https-node-js-server.\r\n(18) Step-by-Step: Creating your own Self-Signed Certificate ... - Medium. https://medium.com/@ansont/step-by-step-creating-your-own-self-signed-certificate-authority-in-node-js-7500550a943a.\r\n(19) undefined. https://localhost:8888.\r\n(20) undefined. https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem.txt.\r\n(21) undefined. https://external-login-api.com.",

        "body":  "There are a number of different concrete types that all implement `IManifestExpressionProvider` and `IValueProvider` however they don\u0027t share a common base type. This makes it difficult to author logic that wants to set an environment variable or similar value to an updated value that includes the existing value, as the custom string interpolation handler requires a single compile-time constant type in order to use the existing value as a token in the interpolated string, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n...\r\nelse if (context.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode)\r\n{\r\n    // WORKAROUND: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3749\r\n    // Set ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS to enable listening on the health checks endpoint\r\n    var healthChecksPort = healthChecksEndpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port);\r\n    if (context.EnvironmentVariables.TryGetValue(ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS, out var existingValue))\r\n    {\r\n        // Preprend the existing value\r\n        var updatedPorts = existingValue switch\r\n        {\r\n            ReferenceExpression expressionValue =\u003e ReferenceExpression.Create($\"{expressionValue};{healthChecksPort}\"),\r\n            EndpointReferenceExpression endpointExpressionValue =\u003e ReferenceExpression.Create($\"{endpointExpressionValue};{healthChecksPort}\"),\r\n            // Should likely be handling other concrete expression types here but they could be in external packages\r\n            _ =\u003e ReferenceExpression.Create($\"{existingValue.ToString()};{healthChecksPort}\")\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        context.EnvironmentVariables[ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS] = updatedPorts;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        context.EnvironmentVariables.Add(ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS, ReferenceExpression.Create($\"8080;{healthChecksPort}\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should consider introducing a common base type or changing the existing `ReferenceExpression` type to be the common base type of `EndpointReferenceExpression`, `ConnectionStringReference`, `StackOutputReference`, etc. It might be more complicated than this though as there are non-reference expression types that also implement `IManifestExpressionProvider` and `IValueProvider`. Perhaps we should introduce a new interface that combines `IManifestExpressionProvider` and `IValueProvider`, e.g. `IExpressionValue`, and have all concrete types implement that. Then the above code could change to the following and would properly support any existing value that implements `IExpressionValue`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n...\r\nelse if (context.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode)\r\n{\r\n    // WORKAROUND: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3749\r\n    // Set ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS to enable listening on the health checks endpoint\r\n    var healthChecksPort = healthChecksEndpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port);\r\n    if (context.EnvironmentVariables.TryGetValue(ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS, out var existingValue))\r\n    {\r\n        // Preprend the existing value\r\n        var updatedPorts = existingValue switch\r\n        {\r\n            IExpressionValue expressionValue =\u003e ReferenceExpression.Create($\"{expressionValue};{healthChecksPort}\"),\r\n            _ =\u003e ReferenceExpression.Create($\"{existingValue.ToString()};{healthChecksPort}\")\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        context.EnvironmentVariables[ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS] = updatedPorts;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        context.EnvironmentVariables.Add(ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS, ReferenceExpression.Create($\"8080;{healthChecksPort}\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",

Now I\u0027m at a place where I\u0027m wondering how something like this should be integrated. What projects should own what responsibilities and what projects should exist for the purpose of this.\r\n\r\nThis particular use-case would only be interesting for those that want to express AWS Lambda Functions in their application model.\r\n\r\n## ASPIRE004\r\nAWS Lambda supports class libraries which required some [changes](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/3866/files#diff-76e7fbb14bac4adf35cc460c45cb9211c6c09cb4f7a0be60a62d805744918237) to `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost.targets` so that the user do not have to configure `SkipValidateAspireHostProjectResources=true`. This change splits evaluation of referenced projects and creation of warnings so that its possible for a different target to run between and set `IsAspireIntegratedClassLibrary=true`.\r\n\r\nThis affects `_AspireProjectResource` which now also has `IsExecutableReference=true/false` and potentially `IsAspireIntegratedClassLibrary=true`.\r\n\r\nWould this change (or alternative implementation) that enables project-by-project suppression of ASPIRE004 be possible?",

Basically what we\u0027re trying to achieve there is that someone could add a reference to an MSBuild.Sdk.SqlProj project and then be able to publish said project to a `SqlServerDatabaseResource`. However, these projects aren\u0027t really executable. All we really need is to fetch some data from the project file. That means we need to get to the path of the project file, which is what `IProjectMetadata` already provides.\r\n\r\nOf course we can live with the warning for the time being, but it would be nice if this could be handled a bit better. For example, I\u0027m wondering if ASPIRE004 shouldn\u0027t be generated by code like `builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyProject\u003e()` rather than the source generation because doing that would actually require the project to be executable.",

        "body":  "Prior to preview 6, I had my own version of `ContainerRegistryHook` and was hoping to move over to the built in one introduced in preview 6.  Unfortunately it doesn\u0027t meet our needs so we\u0027re having to continue with our custom implementation.\r\n\r\n1. Not only do we need to change the registry name, but we also need to add a prefix to the image name.  e.g. we want to convert `docker.io/redis:latest` --\u003e `mycompanymirror.azurecr.io/library/docker.io/redis:latest`. \r\n\r\n2. We only want to rewrite the public image registries, not our own internal ones.  (Currently our logic is to rewrite everything that isn\u0027t `*.azurecr.io`, which whilst not 100% true, works well enough without having to maintain an allow list of all our internal ACRs).  It would be helpful if there was an allow/deny list of what registries should get overwritten.  Examples of when this may be needed\r\n* Your internal mirror and application registries are in separate container registries.\r\n* Different teams in your company push to different registries internally, but you want to rewrite all public images to the same internal mirror without rewriting the internal apps.\r\n\r\nCould you update the built in `ContainerRegistryHook` to account for this?  I think you may want to consider this prior to GA as it may impact the API of how this is configured on `DistributedApplicationOptions`",

        "body":  "`EndpointReference` always resolves to a URI that uses the `ContainerHost` property when evaluated in the context of a container resource, but sometimes the endpoint address using the natural host (i.e. `localhost`) is required.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the eShop workshop, a Keycloak container is used as the IDP. This resource requires the addresses of the web apps using the IDP for federated authentication via OIDC. It actually needs the addresses in two formats:\r\n\r\n1. Resolvable by the IDP itself, i.e. the container host version\r\n2. Resolvable by users in the OIDC flows the IDP and web app clients are part of, i.e. the localhost version\r\n\r\nThis is because as part of the various OIDC flows, the IDP needs to verify that requests originate from URLs allowed for the configured client apps (the non-container-host address), but in some cases it also needs to actually make calls to the client apps (the container-host address).\r\n\r\nIn the workshop app, I had to reconstruct the non-container-host version of the address manually so that it could be injected into the IDP resource: https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/eshop-app-workshop/blob/66226ea402e0d2cb60c52a3d893414e2947525b3/src/eShop.AppHost/Program.cs#L48-L64\r\n\r\nWe should make it possible to specify which host property is used when an `EndpointReference` is resolved.\r\n",

This will insanely help with testing scenarios of failovers locally - test what happens if you just turn off the database, and than rescale it\r\n\r\nThis would like smth like this:\r\n\r\n![image_2024-06-02_00-06-29](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/assets/46647517/eb97c13b-7225-4277-9883-78e8af90011f)\r\n\r\nThis will also resolve issue https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3095 - as one of the ways to perform \"complete stop\" of the service (or even restart, after some time, with specified replica count we want)\r\n\r\nHowever, It seems easy to add this feature for .NET apps, but it\u0027s might be not so trivial for applications where nodes are required to be in state of consensus (any leader-election, multimaster or master-replica architecture) (for example Kafka or Postgres), because it might be required to add info to all brokers/servers about new added host.",

Create a solution using the Aspire Starter Application with the following options\r\n- [ ] - Configure for HTTPS\r\n- [ ] - Use Redis...\r\n- [x] - Create a test project\r\n\r\n2. Build \u0026 run the tests, observe everything passes.\r\n3. Add a Directory.Build.Props to the solution root with the following:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\n\u003cProject ToolsVersion=\"15.0\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\"\u003e\r\n  \u003cPropertyGroup\u003e\r\n    \u003cPlatform Condition=\" \u0027$(Platform)\u0027 == \u0027\u0027 \"\u003eAny CPU\u003c/Platform\u003e\r\n  \u003c/PropertyGroup\u003e\r\n\u003c/Project\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u003e :warning: Yes, the above is probably not needed and came way before my time. I can easily remove the offending line, but figured I would escalate this to the team as it gave me trouble and hope to not have others fall into the same trap😅 \r\n\r\n4. Observe the tests now hang indefinitely and time out.\r\n\r\n## Expectation\r\n\r\nI would expect this behavior to:\r\n\r\n1. not happen at all (i\u0027m not sure _why_ it\u0027s happening, i did some cursory looking at the Aspire code and nothing jumped out)\r\n2. consistently happen when running the application vs testing 🤷‍♂️ ",

Could you confirm which version of Aspire you are using by running `dotnet workload list` or checking which version of the Hosting package you are referencing in your AppHost project?\r\n\r\nMy hunch just by reading your (very detailed 😃) report, is that you may be running into https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3939, which would be likely if the version you are using is `8.0.1` or earlier. This issue has been fixed in `8.1.0` previews but we haven\u0027t released those yet to NuGet.\r\n\r\nA quick summary of why I think this is the root cause, is that in order for the app host to launch your services (resources) it uses some assembly attributes that make some assumptions of where to find some executables required to run your app and your tests. I believe what may be going on is that by some of these changes you are making in configuration, some of those assumptions may be invalid and therefore causing an issue.",

We do this today in a couple of tests, Qdrant and Milvus.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/3ddc4cacc5b23f68acd09307b5741e6760bd5fc7/tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/Qdrant/AddQdrantTests.cs#L176-L184\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/3ddc4cacc5b23f68acd09307b5741e6760bd5fc7/tests/Aspire.Hosting.Tests/Qdrant/AddQdrantTests.cs#L314-L319\r\n\r\nThe issue is that while `IProjectMetadata` is public, it contains `internal` DIM\u0027d properties \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/3ddc4cacc5b23f68acd09307b5741e6760bd5fc7/src/Aspire.Hosting/IProjectMetadata.cs#L13-L23\r\n\r\nThis means that unless `Aspire.Hosting` has InternalsVisibleTo the test (which it won\u0027t if these extensions are outside this repo), the test can\u0027t fill in these \"for testing\" properties, and an exception occurs because we try to read the ProjectPath, which doesn\u0027t exist.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this, when adding the project the test can set `o =\u003e o.ExcludeLaunchProfile = true` which tells the hosting code to not try to load the launch profile.

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen using the fluent-like API in the .NET Aspire app model developers sometimes find themselves wanting to conditionally apply a method to a resource builder. For example, you might want to only add a reference to a resource in publish mode, or for a particular environment.\r\n\r\nToday to do this you need to break out of the fluent pattern to add conditional blocks to do this because C# doesn\u0027t have an inline conditional method invocation (as far as I know). Example of current approach:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar db = builder.AddPostgres(\"pgsql\").AddDatabase(\"db\");\r\nvar myapp = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyApp\u003e(\"myapp\")\r\n                   .WithReference(db);\r\n\r\nif (builder.ExecutionContext.Operation = DistributedApplicationOperation.Publish)\r\n{\r\n    var ai = builder.AddAzureApplicationInsights(\"ai\");\r\n    myapp.WithReference(ai);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes the code look a lot less concise. Here is an example which inspired this API proposal:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/eShop/pull/464\r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\nWe welcome API proposals! We have a process to evaluate the value and shape of new API. There is an overview of our process [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/APIReviewProcess.md). This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\r\nFirst, please describe the purpose and value of the new API here.\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting;\r\n\r\npublic static class ResourceBuilderExtensions\r\n{\r\n+    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e When\u003cT\u003e(\r\n+        this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder,\r\n+        Func\u003cbool\u003e predicate,\r\n+        Action\u003cIResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e\u003e callback) where T: IResource\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nApplying the example above to this new API design:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar db = builder.AddPostgres(\"pgsql\").AddDatabase(\"db\");\r\nvar myapp = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyApp\u003e(\"myapp\")\r\n                   .WithReference(db);\r\n                   .When(builder.Execution.Operation == DistributedApplicationOperation.Publish, b =\u003e {\r\n                       var ai = builder.AddAzureApplicationInsights(\"ai\");\r\n                       b.WithReference(ai);\r\n                   });\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo help make things even more concise we could add reusable conditional functions:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar db = builder.AddPostgres(\"pgsql\").AddDatabase(\"db\");\r\nvar myapp = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyApp\u003e(\"myapp\")\r\n                   .WithReference(db);\r\n                   .When(builder.Execution.PublishCondition, b =\u003e {\r\n                       var ai = builder.AddAzureApplicationInsights(\"ai\");\r\n                       b.WithReference(ai);\r\n                   });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nWe could add conditional logic to methods like `WithReference` and `WithEnvironment`. However this would further complicate the set of overloads on these methods so this general purpose helper method is probably the most flexible building block that doesn\u0027t require additional ongoing work to implement.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nOne day we might get a more elaborate method invocation syntax for C# which makes this redundant.",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nThis API proposal aims to make it easier to have multiple dynamic launch URLs during development, and to deep link to URLs in the dashboard.\r\n\r\nI am looking for feedback on this API. Thank you.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nHere is the draft PR for this API proposal: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/5277\r\n\r\nA new `EndpointUrlAnnotation` type is added to annotate URLs relative to dynamic endpoints. These annotations have properties to launch the URL at startup in the default system web browser, as well as to exclude the URL from the dashboard. URLs are set to not launch by default, but do show in the dashboard by default.\r\n\r\nA new `LaunchEndpointUrlLifecycleHook` type is added to launch URLs after the endpoints are allocated.\r\n\r\n`ApplicationExecutor` is updated to use these new annotations to construct URLs that are returned from the app host to the dashboard. This allows for deep links to parts of the app that were not previously possible with URLs from endpoints alone.\r\n\r\n`WithEndpointUrl()` and similar HTTP and HTTPS variations are added to make it easy for developers to use these new features.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nHere is an example that launches a Scalar UI for interacting with Open API.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n// AppHost/Program.cs\r\n\r\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.ApiService\u003e(\"apiservice\")\r\n    .WithHttpsEndpointUrl(\r\n        relativeUrl: \"/scalar/v1\",\r\n        isLaunchUrl: true,\r\n        excludeFromDashboard: false);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nA previous version of this proposal just implemented launch URLs and did not include changes to the dashboard.\r\n\r\nAnother option instead of adding a new annotation type would be to modify the URL types used throughout the app host and dashboard to include the additional properties and relative URL. This seemed like a riskier option so I did not pursue it.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nDevelopers new to Aspire could be confused with the difference between the existing Endpoint and the new EndpointUrl. We may want to give these new APIs a different name. For example: ShortcutUrl.\r\n",

Maybe this will help more:\n\n\nYou can pull my [udap-dotnet-tutorial](https://github.com/JoeShook/udap-dotnet-tutorial) repo and see for your self.\n\nThe [program.cs](https://github.com/JoeShook/udap-dotnet-tutorial/blob/main/aspire.AppHost/Program.cs) in aspire.AppHost shows that I am pulling in a Dockerfile, Dockerfile.UdapEd (the UI tool).  But in reality Dockerfile.UdapEd is pulling an external image.  Dockerfile.UdapEd is adding a trust anchor that I generated so that the UdapEd UI tool trusts the udap-tutorial-dev-tls-cert.  \n\nThis tutorial is required to use TLS.  And there is another layer of PKI not part of TLS.  It is the implementation of [UDAP](https://www.udap.org/).  Basicaly, OAuth2 profiled to use PKI.  It is a scalable and secure solution to OAuth2.  That specification relies on things like CRL resolution and AIA resolution, so yet another reason each of those services listed in the [program.cs](https://github.com/JoeShook/udap-dotnet-tutorial/blob/main/aspire.AppHost/Program.cs) need something like ```host.docker.internal``` to discover those other services.\n\nBut why would I want the endpoints in the Aspire dashboard to show https://host.docker.internal vs https://localhost?  Technically from the dashboard I don\u0027t need it but it does tell a better story to the user.\n\nLike if you were to launch the UdapEd tool and and exercise it you have to use the ```host.docker.internal``` to find the FHIR server as depicted in the image below by the arrow pointing to the field just below the Enter BaseUrl.  \n\nAnd while working on this I realized I cannot for the life of me configure .NET Aspire to allow me to run the ```UdapEd``` UI from any domain other than localhost.  I guess I don\u0027t need it to run from host.docker.internal domain.  The OAuth2 authorization code flow still works fine.  Another thing I can\u0027t do, that was a bit surprising and burned a lot of time thinking I was doing something wrong.\n\n ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e80106-aea3-47d0-9186-37681d93a4c2)",

Are you using Docker Desktop, Podman, something else? And are you able to get the mount configured correctly by using Docker CLI directly? If so, please share the command. \r\n\r\nHere is what I *think* is happening. If you are running your Aspire program from Windows, which seems like you do, I am not aware of a solution that would allow you to bind-mount the Docker socket from Windows host into your container. There simply is no \"Docker socket\" on the Windows host--e.g. Docker Desktop uses a named pipe instead https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/general/#how-do-i-connect-to-the-remote-docker-engine-api and I do not think the bind mount syntax will work to proxy between Unix domain socket on the container side and a Windows named pipe on the Windows host side.\r\n\r\nYour best bet is probably to run your Aspire program from within WSL subsystem, then\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.WithBindMount(\"/var/run/docker.sock\", \"/var/run/docker.sock\", isReadOnly: true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould work, assuming the Docker socked is available from within WSL subsystem.\r\n\r\n@danegsta please chime in if I confused something here.",

I think I know what is going on.\r\n\r\nLooks like Docker Desktop is treating the host path `/var/run/docker.sock` in a very special way. It allows to \"bind mount\" that path into the container even though it does not exist on the host machine at all; instead it silently creates a bind mount into Docker daemon VM. I am quite surprised that it works and I could not find anything about this special treatment in the Docker Desktop documentation, but it kind of makes sense.\r\n\r\nAspire should probably special-case this mount source (`/var/run/docker.sock`) as well. Specifically\r\n\r\n- `WithAnnotation()` results in an unnecessary `C:\\var\\run\\docker.sock` folder being created because Aspire (DCP specifically) is trying to be helpful and noticed that you are attempting a bind mount from a folder that does not exist on the machine. So it is trying to create that folder for you. We should stop doing that for `/var/run/docker.sock`.\r\n\r\n-  `WithContainerRuntimeArgs()` may not work simply because there should be two paramenters passed to it, that is, the way to call it is `WithContainerRuntimeArgs(\"-v\", \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\")`. Would appreciate a verification here; this should work.\r\n\r\n- `WithBindMount()` does not work because Aspire is trying to compute the absolute path to `/var/run/docker.sock` and failing at that https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/src/Aspire.Hosting/ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.cs#L80 We should not do this for `/var/run/docker.sock` source.",

It’s just an inconvenience that I have to do that, and I can guess many people won’t know or think about doing that.\r\n\r\nI’m using a Nix shell for my project, automated with direnv. The way these tools isolate the shell is essentially by adding and augmenting a bunch of environment variables. Several of those are `PATH`-type lists of file system references. For instance, I have a 17k characters long `PYTHONPATH` that’s only there because of me having the Azure CLI (with a few extensions) installed by my `flake.nix`. My `PATH` is over 5K char.\r\n\r\nMost of those things are *not* needed by my applicative code per se, some of them eventually *could* be, in any case it’s much more practical to have them up at all time when I’m developing/devopsing. Unused environment variables shouldn’t cause problems.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nlocalhost, being used by so many different things, can get clogged up with cookies causing HTTP 431 \"Request Header Fields Too Large\" errors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it\u0027s not always possible to test or catch certain issues when everything uses localhost. CORS errors for example.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI\u0027d like Microsoft or the Aspire team to register a domain name specifically for Aspire to use with local development.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of my examples below, lets say you register `aspire.dev`.\r\n\r\nYou would then create a wildcard DNS A record `*.aspire.dev` pointing to `127.0.0.1` and an AAAA record `*.aspire.dev` pointing to `::1`.\r\n\r\nWithin Aspire when running the apphost locally, you would then have it create all endpoints that would have been localhost using subdomains of aspire.dev instead.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\nvar databasePassword = builder.AddParameter(\"DatabasePassword\", true);\r\nvar db = builder.AddPostgres(\"Database\", password: databasePassword)\r\n  .WithHealthCheck()\r\n  .WithDataVolume($\"AppHost-{Enum.GetName(databaseType)}-{name}-data\")\r\n  .WithPgAdmin()\r\n  .AddDatabase(\"myApp\");\r\n\r\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Application_Host_Api\u003e(\"MyApi\")\r\n  .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\r\n  .WithReference(db, dbOptions.ConnectionStringName)\r\n  .WaitFor(db);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above apphost would create the following endpoints:\r\n\r\n- Database:\r\n  - tcp - tcp://database.aspire.dev:54895 (port set as before)\r\n- Database-pgadmin:\r\n  - http - http://database-pgadmin.aspire.dev:54896/\r\n- MyApi:\r\n  - http - http://my-api.aspire.dev:5260/swagger (note kebab-casing from PascalCasing)\r\n  - https - http://my-api.aspire.dev:7285/swagger\r\n\r\nIf more randomness is needed to avoid naming collisions, a simple 4-6 character random string could be added. e.g. `http://my-api-dfghas.aspire.dev:7285/swagger`\r\n\r\nAs a stretch goal, you could also add the option to configure your own base domain for this, which would allow developers and organisations to use Hosts file entries or internal corporate DNS servers to have the same functionality without needing to do a DNS lookup across the internet (for those with more stringent security requirements)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n[Lando](https://lando.dev/), another docker-based local development tool for PHP, does this already. When spinning up local environments using Lando it uses subdomains of `lndo.site` which has a 127.0.0.1 wildcard A record.\r\n\r\nhttps://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=a%3aadfkljlgkh.lndo.site\u0026run=toolpage\r\n\r\n",

Not just a gut feeling.  The absence of good out of the box solutions for this kind of stuff is an industry-wide challenge and a huge value that Aspire has the potential to offer (read: differentiator!).\r\n\r\nIs there anything proactive you could do here to at least give the Aspire team more wiggle room?  For example, I did a quick lookup of [reserved TLDs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606#section-2).  Perhaps those could be used?\r\n\r\n(Might have to make sure major browsers aren\u0027t doing special detections for these names, but chrome-based browsers seem to attempt resolution.)",

Proving negatives is a foundational aspect of logic (ex. the law of contradiction).\r\n\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy)#Proving_a_negative\r\n- https://departments.bloomu.edu/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/proveanegative.pdf\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(truth)\r\n\r\nFurther, consider the \"zero-trust\" security principle. The main concept behind the zero trust security model is \"never trust, always verify\". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model\r\n\r\nSo on this point, I must agree with @blowdart and his stance. however, I think we\u0027ve found some sufficiently secure approaches in the discourse above :)",

The dev cert will be updated to support `*.localhost` (and `*.internal` for non-localhost scenarios) and the empty and blazor templates have been updated with an option to use a local hostname like `https://myap.localhost:12345`. See dotnet/aspnetcore#62593\n\nIn addition we\u0027re doing work in Aspire 9.4 to better support endpoints with non-localhost hostnames and ensuring we display the appropriate resolvable URLs for them in the dashboard. At this stage the endpoint URLs used for service discovery configuration will still be \"localhost\" for all cases except when the endpoint is configured to listen on a specific IP address.\n\nNote that modern browsers already bypass DNS and resolve `*.localhost` addresses to the loopback address which is what motivated this change and why service discovery addresses continue to use `localhost` as SD is generally consumed by non-browser clients.",

Please describe the problem.\r\n\r\nI left a broken app running for over 20 minutes, and the resource state remained `Waiting`.  Should this have timed out by now and gone into `FailedToStart`?\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a86d2c5-686a-4f98-a9ba-e9e094b06c6c)\r\n\r\nEven worse is when the same thing happens during an integration test - the `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.BuildAsync().StartAsync()` method just hangs, with little other information available through the debugger (and even less if the test is running in CI).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\r\n\r\nWhilst I\u0027m less fussed about the hang when the dashboard is accessible as you can find the information you need there (somewhat related to #5544), hanging tests with no diagnostic data is far more painful.\r\n\r\nFor the test scenario, I\u0027d like to see a default (but overridable) timeout either on individual `WaitFor` calls, or a timeout on the whole `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.BuildAsync().StartAsync()`.  Whilst a user could apply their own timeout by adding `WaitAsync()`, the test will then fail with a generic `The operation has timed out` error, which doesn\u0027t give you much to go and troubleshoot.  Tiemout support built in to aspire could fail with a better error message, that will be captured by test runners \u0026 CI systems e.g.\r\n\u003e Application failed to start as \u0027Foo\u0027, \u0027Bar\u0027 and \u0027Baz\u0027 failed to reach the `Starting` state.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThere is some overlap with #5632, however this issue is a more specifically related to `WaitFor` .\r\n\r\nAlso want to stress that despite the deluge of issues I\u0027ve been logging around `WaitFor`, I do love what has been implemented so far.  Just logging things I\u0027m discovering as I play around this evening.",

(+ any other UI that comes with `WaitFor` and health checks)\r\n\r\nI still think there should be a sanity timeout with `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder`  (e.g. 5 mins).  Whilst it is possible to set a timeout through a custom cancellation token on `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.StartAsync`, that does require you to first realise that you\u0027re test is going to timeout.  And I\u0027d expect if your application hangs due to something with `WaitOn` in a test, it\u0027s most likely accidental.  Even worse is if there\u0027s something different with CI so everything passes locally, but fails in Github Actions / Azure Pipelines / whatever tool where you have limited debug options and can\u0027t reproduce locally.\r\n\r\nThat said, if there is an opt-in default timeout, `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` could make use of that to implement such a sanity timeout.\r\n\r\nThe sanity timeout would need to be set high enough that it gives images enough time to pull over bad network connections, although if it\u0027s only configured by default on `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder`, then it\u0027s may not be the end of the world if it occasionally fails on the edge case you have a poor internet connection, no cached image and are pulling several large new images",

The property already is nullable so consumers should be able to handle this possibility.  This also makes it consistent with `ContainerImageAnnotaiton.Repository` which we leave as null rather than defaulting to `docker.io`.\r\n\r\nFixing this will also provide a partial solution to #4355 as it is the addition of an additional `latest` tag that breaks container references given to `WithImage()`.  (Note, this is only a partial solution to that problem as whilst DCP will start the correct container, the `ContainerResourceAnnotation` is not correctly broken down to it\u0027s constituent parts.)  You can see this behaviour as the following will start up the expected container once the tag has been reset to null.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"a1\", \"mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:8.1\", null!);\r\nvar x = builder.AddContainer(\"a2\", \"mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:8.1\")\r\n    .WithImageTag(null!);\r\n```",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWe are looking into how we can support adding a AWS Lambda Function to the `DistributedApplicationBuilder`. A Lambda function can be written as an executable or as a class library. The class library programming model being the more common approach.\n\nThe executable approach is not an issue for Aspire but for the class library we need to customize the execution arguments. Lambda functions coded as a class library are started with a host executable and the depsfile and runtimeconfig are overriden at startup. The class library is passed in as an argument to the host executable. For example if we had .NET project called \"ClassLibraryLambdaFunction\" that contained a Lambda function it would be executed using the following:\n\n```\ndotnet exec --depsfile ./ClassLibraryLambdaFunction.deps.json --runtimeconfig ./ClassLibraryLambdaFunction.runtimeconfig.json ../../../../AspireExtensions/LambdaHost/Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport.dll ClassLibraryLambdaFunction::ClassLibraryLambdaFunction.Function::FunctionHandler\n```\n\nHaving this configured in the launchSettings.json file by the user is not practical and as part of an `AddAWSLambdaFunction` method I want to be able to setup all of these command line arguments for the user and return a LambdaProjectResource that is a subclass of ProjectResource. \n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nWhen adding project to the `DistributedApplicationBuilder` you can only specify the launchSettings profile name for configuring how the project should be started. I would like to propose adding a **LaunchSettingsOverrideAnnotation** annotation where all of the command line arguments for the \"dotnet\" command can be specified. The [ApplicationExecutor](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/07f1f34dd5c0b7bf5f1f3294cbcc9965af218b91/src/Aspire.Hosting/Dcp/ApplicationExecutor.cs#L1058) would look for the annotation and if exists use it for setting up the parameters for the process.\n\n### Update February 2nd, 2025\n\nThe issue has gotten long and a bit off the original ask. We currently have a work around by writing a launchsettings profile during Aspire startup that matches the arguments set in the AppHost plus other settings to launch a class library. The work around works but it feels hacky to write to the launchsettings.json file which will cause users to change files.\n\nThe ideal solution for us is to have APIs as part of Aspire that essentially defines a launch profile in memory and hand that off to either the `dotnet run` or the IDE depending on whether Aspire has an IDE attached to it. I understand that is a larger task because it requires changes to the protocol for Aspire to talk to the IDE.",

If this was launched via the IDE would the IDE attach the debugger to it?\n\nI do have the challenge that within a class library there could me multiple Lambda functions that need to be started up separately with different argument to identity the .NET method to call. Imagine in an Aspire AppHost the same project being added multiple times to the distributed application but with a different \"handler\" string that identifies what method to call. Maybe what I could do is have the MSBuild targets for running the class library look at an environment variable that the Aspire AppHost sets on the process. I\u0027ll play around and see what I can do.",

The POC was made back in September and using a class library worked using the launchsettings.json file. We are picking the project back up now turning the POC into a real product and now using the latest bits the class library no longer seems to work.\n\nTo repo:\n* Clone https://github.com/normj/LambdaAspirePOC\n* checkout branch **classlibrary-failure**\n* In VS launch the AppHost\n* Notice the PID for `ToLowerLambdaFunction` project resource is 0 and there is nothing written to the logs. My guess is Aspire didn\u0027t even try to run the project because the output type was not an executable. Similar to the error we saw when using `dotnet run` complaining about the output type. \"A runnable project should target a runnable TFM (for instance, net5.0) and have OutputType \u0027Exe\u0027.\"\n\nWhat is supposed to happen is the `ClassLibraryLambdaFunction` project has a profile in the `launchSettings.json` that provides the actual executable entry point that should be used. \n```\n{\n  \"profiles\": {\n    \"LambdaRuntimeClient_FunctionHandler\": {\n      \"commandName\": \"Executable\",\n      \"commandLineArgs\": \"exec --depsfile ./ClassLibraryLambdaFunction.deps.json --runtimeconfig ./ClassLibraryLambdaFunction.runtimeconfig.json ../../../../AspireExtensions/LambdaHost/Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport.dll ClassLibraryLambdaFunction::ClassLibraryLambdaFunction.Function::FunctionHandler\",\n      \"workingDirectory\": \".\\\\bin\\\\$(Configuration)\\\\net8.0\",\n      \"executablePath\": \"dotnet\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the `AddAWSLambdaFunction` extension method you can see I set the launch setting profile. https://github.com/normj/LambdaAspirePOC/blob/classlibrary-failure/AspireExtensions/Aspire.Hosting.AWS.Lambda/LambdaExtensions.cs#L22\n\nIf you make the `ClassLibraryLambdaFunction` the startup project you can confirm the profile actually starts up till you get an expected error about \"Invalid URI\". Through the AppHost it makes sure that URI is correctly set up.\n\nKeep in mind my ultimate goal and the original reason for this issue is I want to get rid of dealing with the launchsettings.json file and from my `AddAWSLambdaFunction` extension method tell Aspire all of the command line arguments needed to run the class library.\n\n\n",

The invocation arguments (`args` in the API definition that we are changing in that PR) are arguments that can override those in the launch profile, if specified. They are passed from DCP to the IDE as part of the run session request.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what populates the invocation arguments. You may well be right that there\u0027s nothing in the API to do so. I was just hoping Karol might know of a way to finesse it to pass what you need in the short term, even if definitely not something you\u0027d do long term. Otherwise I don\u0027t think we have a workaround (from this angle at least) until the fixes flow through. ",

        "body":  "There are scenarios where it\u0027s desirable to utilize multi-stage container builds to have a single Dockerfile that can be setup to work one way during run mode (e.g. assuming a bind mount to the app files and enabling a dev server for hot reload) and another way for publish (copying the app files and starting without hot reload). There is no way to easily change the build stage used other than passing it directly into the call to `AddDockerfile`. An extension method that does this can\u0027t be made in the app as `DockerBuildAnnotation` is internal.\n\nRight now, one has to instead conditionally call a different overload of `AddDockerfile` itself, as well as likely conditionally calling extension methods, e.g.:\n\n```csharp\nvar pythonInference =\n    (builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode\n        ? builder.AddDockerfile(\"python-inference\", \"../PythonInference\", null, \"base\")\n        : builder.AddDockerfile(\"python-inference\", \"../PythonInference\"))\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 62394, env: \"UVICORN_PORT\")\n    .WithContainerRuntimeArgs(\"--gpus=all\")\n    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);\n\nif (builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode)\n{\n    pythonInference\n        .WithBindMount(\"../PythonInference\", \"/app\")\n        .WithArgs(\"--reload\");\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, the build stage can be determined first and then passed in to the longest overload:\n\n```csharp\nvar stage = builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode ? \"base\" : \"publish\";\nvar pythonInference = builder.AddDockerfile(\"python-inference\", \"../PythonInference\", null, stage)\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 62394, env: \"UVICORN_PORT\")\n    .WithContainerRuntimeArgs(\"--gpus=all\")\n    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);\n\nif (builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode)\n{\n    pythonInference\n        .WithBindMount(\"../PythonInference\", \"/app\")\n        .WithArgs(\"--reload\");\n}\n```\n\n## Proposal\n\nIt would allow for cleaner app host code to have a `WithBuildStage` method that could be conditionally called, e.g.:\n\n```csharp\n// Add the python inference app\nvar pythonInference = builder.AddDockerfile(\"python-inference\", \"../PythonInference\")\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 62394, env: \"UVICORN_PORT\")\n    .WithContainerRuntimeArgs(\"--gpus=all\")\n    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);\n\nif (builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode)\n{\n    // Configure the python inference app for development\n    pythonInference\n        .WithBuildStage(\"base\")\n        .WithBindMount(\"../PythonInference\", \"/app\")\n        .WithArgs(\"--reload\");\n}\n```\n\n```dockerfile\n# Start from the python image\nFROM python:3.12.5-slim as base\n\n# Set the working directory, the app files will be bind-mounted here during dev\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the requirements file\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Ensure the server is accessible from outside the container\nENV UVICORN_HOST=0.0.0.0\n\n# Set the entry point to run the application \nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"-m\", \"uvicorn\", \"main:app\"]\n\n# Ensure CMD is empty\nCMD []\n\n# Create the publish stage\nFROM base as publish\n\n# Copy application files from the host as there\u0027s no bind-mount\nCOPY . .\n```",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nVisiting the console logs page causes Aspire to load logs. For DCP resources, the host calls DCP get to get its old logs, streaming them from beginning to end, and then continuing to stream new logs as they arrive.\n\nThe problem with this the order doesn\u0027t match what is shown in the Aspire. Aspire wants to shows the latest logs by default, with a scrollbar to go back and view older logs.\n\nBy streaming logs from the beginning, the UI rapidly updates as it quickly tries to render logs from beginning to end, causing the UI to freeze, lock up, and generally behave badly. A resource with 10,000 logs does a lot of UI updates for lines 1-9900 before 9901-10000 are actually displayed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIdeally:\n\n1. The dashboard quickly displays the latest logs.\n2. The dashboard streams new logs as they arrive.\n3. The dashboard loads historical logs in the background.\n\nA couple of solutions I see:\n\n1. The current DCP method to get console logs is tweaked:\n    1. Add a parameter to limit the amount of historical logs returned. The dashboard never attempts to show more than 10,000 logs in the past so this could be passed to provide an upper limit on the amount of data DCP attempts to return.\n    2. The DCP method adds a header with a count of the current number of logs available. This could be used by Aspire to display a loading indicator in logs. The console logs wouldn\u0027t start being displayed until the amount of lines received from DCP equals this line count. This change would stop the UI from trying to display older logs as they\u0027re returned. The downside is there would be a delay while displaying the loading indicator as old logs are loaded.\n\n2. Another option would be for there to be two calls to get log data from DCP:\n    1. One call to stream the last 100 logs, plus new logs. This call would need to return a total log count in the header so the line number is accurate when logs are initially displayed.\n    2. Another call to stream historical logs. It would load old logs in the background.\n    3. NOTE: Aspire host doesn\u0027t use the order that logs are received for ordering, just the date. Theoritically there could be one API call that simulatanously returns logs from newest to oldest while at the same time returning latest logs.\n\nI think option 1 is probably easy both from hosting and DCP perspective. Option 2 would create a better experience by making logs consistently load quickly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

The following is the set of new options for log requests that can be implemented while keeping these constraints satisfied:\n\n1. `limit=N` this would limit the logs response to N log lines. This option is compatible with `tail` and `since` (see below), but not `follow`.\n2. `tail=N`limits the logs response to (at most) N EXISTING, newest log lines. If `follow` is set, new log lines that appear after the log stream was created do not count against the limit, and will be streamed until the client closes the stream. Not compatible with `since`.\n3. `since=T` limits the logs response to log lines created after timestamp T. \n\nUnfortunately it is not possible for DCP to efficiently determine how many log lines are available for Containers. We could implement that for Executables only if that helps.\n\nI believe the dashboard could implement efficient log retrieval by combining the \"latest log\" stream (`tail=page_size, follow=true`) with retrieving \"previous pages\" of logs on demand (`tail=reverse_page_number*page_size, limit=page_size`). Let me know please if my understanding is correct and if the `since` option makes things easier.\n\n@danegsta @dbreshears FYI",

In the UI we want to immediately display the newest logs.\n\nIdeally what we want is:\n1. Get logs from newest to oldest, and\n2. Get new logs as they arrive\n\nThat lets the UI quickly show the latest log content, with older logs loading in over time (1), while at the same time showing new logs as they arrive (2). Perhaps there should be two calls to DCP to get this data.\n\nNext time there is a free hard problems meeting we should discuss this area. I apprieticate there are technical limitations, so a real time discussion about what work best would be good.",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\n\nIn .NET Aspire 9.0 we have introduced `WithLifetime(...)` which allows container resources to retained after the apphost and DCP exits. This works well in most cases however sometimes resources need to be configured in a certain wait in order for persistence to work well.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to constraint which resources can participate in lifetime mechanics and also allow resources themselves to assert whether they are correctly configured to support lifetime.\n\n## Proposed API\n\nThe first edition would be the introduction of a new interface that can be applied to any resource to signal that it supports lifetime management.\n\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n\n+ public interface IResourceWithLifetime\n+ {\n+   void SupportsLifetime(ContainerLifetime lifetime);\n+ }\n```\n\nWe would then remove the existing WithLifetime method:\n\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting\n\npublic static class ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions\n{\n-    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithLifetime\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, ContainerLifetime lifetime) where T : ContainerResource\n}\n```\n\n... and be replace with another using the new interface as a constraint:\n\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting\n\npublic static class ResourceBuilderExtensions\n{\n+    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithLifetime\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, ResourceLifetime lifetime) where T : IResourceWithLifetime\n}\n```\n\nWhen the application starts up, `ApplicationExecutor` or the code that handles lifetime would call the SupportsLifetime method and give it an opportunity to throw a specific exception to help developers figure out what configuration might be necessary for correctly support lifetime options on the resource they are using.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThe usage would look exactly the same as it does today for `WithLifetime` except it would not be limited to container resources (we would provide a default implementation for IResourceWithLifetime for ContainerResource with a virtual implementation).\n\nThe implementation might look something like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic class RedisInsightResource : ContainerResource, IResourceWithLifetime\n{\n  void IResourceWithLifetime.SupportsLifetime(ResourceLifetime lifetime)\n  {\n    // Assert that proxy is disabled (if a proxy is enabled then after DCP shuts down you won\u0027t be able to access the app.\n    // Assert that data volume is enabled (maybe).\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nTBD\n\n## Risks\n\nThis would be a breaking change.\n",

Please describe the problem.\n\nI love the addition of `WithLifetime` in the new version of Aspire, but am a bit surprised it\u0027s limited to container-based resources. I would love to use it with other things, e.g. Node/Npm resources. There\u0027s really not much point in having to restart `npm watch` on every Aspire startup for example. I\u0027m also working on a custom resource which would manage locally-run Azurite instance, which would extend `ExecutableResource` and would also benefit from not being restarted every time we stop/start the App Host.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI think adding support for `WithLifetime` to `ExecutableResource` would make a lot of sense.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "With the introduction of `ResourceCommandAnnotation` we\u0027ve added the ability for integration developers to offer up actions that users can initiate via the portal. When a command is executed a short lived \"toast\" notification is displayed to the end user.\n\nI believe that there are further experiences that we may wish to provide via the dashboard to streamline app development which require a more interactive experience. A simple scenario would be prompting for parameter values.\n\nWhen an application launches that requires parameter values, if they are missing then there will be an exception when they are used and the developer will need to stop debugging and then put the parameters in the config file and then re-launch the app host.\n\nInstead of this we could provide two new APIs in the app model - `INotificationService` and `IDialogService` (we can bikeshed the names later). These two interfaces could be used to provide inline experiences in the dashboard.\n\nThe notification service could be used to add a persistent notification in a visible location on the dashboard. The notification would have data model that would allow it to be interacted with. Here is just an example:\n\n```csharp\nvar notification = _notificationService.AddNotification(new {\n  Title = \"Missing parameter\",\n  Description = \"Please provide the missing parameter for ...\",\n  DefaultAction = new NotificationAction(\"Provide value\", async (context, ct) =\u003e {\n      var dialogResult = await _dialogService.OpenDialogAsync(url);\n      \n      if (dialogResult != DialogResult.Cancelled)\n      {\n        await context.Notification.CloseAsync(ct);\n      }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nA few landmarks to point out. Notifications are persistent until they are cancelled (or an optional timeout is specified). Any code with access to the container in the app host could use this service. The dialog service similarly could be called from anywhere but in this context its called from the default action callback on the notification.\n\nIn this case it opens a URL which would become modal on the dashboard and display a webpage which could be offered up either by the app host or a container (allowing for some slick UX scenarios for integrations).",

However, this is not available on all environments. e.g. it likely doesn\u0027t work in the following cases:\n1. Docker in WSL (see this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63898430/how-can-i-access-a-service-running-on-wsl2-from-inside-a-docker-container))\n1. Docker engine on Windows without Docker Desktop\n1. Podman\n1. Docker Engine on Linux\n\nThis issue exists both for http and https traffic, but https presents an additional level of complexity. Even with Docker Desktop, it is problematic because containers don\u0027t have the self-signed cert that would allow them to talk to the host. ANd even if they did, it wouldn\u0027t work because the cert is only for `localhost`, and not `host.docker.internal`.\n\nOne potential solution is to use a reverse tunnel, similar to what @davidfowl does in https://github.com/davidfowl/YarpTunnelDemo. The trick that makes this work is that the communication is initiated from the Host to the proxy container, and not from a Container to the Host. And yet, its reverse nature effectively allows Container to Host communication, without ever needing to talk to a host port.\n\nHere is an illustration (courtesy of @davidfowl):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20ed367b-e97b-4fd7-94d0-269a642e113e)\n",

Basic idea was to create a proxy container that would act as one side of a tunnel to route traffic through DCP and out to the host services.\n\nWe considered something like the SOCKS protocol, but we have to establish the connection between host and container on the opposite direction of a normal proxy flow. Karol has been doing some research into various proxy libraries to see if any off the shelf implementations can already do what we need and I wrote up an initial draft of a possible SOCKS inspired protocol we could use if we needed to implement the proxy ourselves.

                                           "body":  "We’ve traced this to how **Podman runs containers inside a lightweight VM**:\n\n* Inside the container, `host.containers.internal` resolves to the **Podman VM**, not your physical host.\n* To let containers call host-side services, point that hostname at the **VM’s gateway IP** (the host as seen from the VM).\n* Also ensure containerized apps **bind to `0.0.0.0`** (not just `localhost`) so traffic arriving through the gateway can reach them.\n\n### Workaround (Windows)\n\n1. Get the gateway IP (the “via” address):\n\n   ```powershell\n   wsl -d podman-machine-default -- ip -4 route show default\n   ```\n\n   Example output: `default via 172.20.112.1 dev eth0 …` → gateway = `172.20.112.1`.\n2. Run containers with:\n\n   ```\n   --add-host=host.containers.internal:\u003cgatewayIP\u003e\n   ```\n3. Ensure services inside containers listen on `0.0.0.0`.\n\n### Workaround (macOS)\n\n1. Get the gateway IP from the Podman VM:\n\n   ```bash\n   podman machine ssh podman-machine-default ip -4 route show default\n   ```\n\n   Example: `default via 192.168.127.1 dev eth0 …` → gateway = `192.168.127.1`.\n2. Run containers with:\n\n   ```\n   --add-host=host.containers.internal:\u003cgatewayIP\u003e\n   ```\n3. Ensure services inside containers listen on `0.0.0.0`.\n\n\u003e Tip: You can make the mapping global by setting `host_containers_internal_ip = \"\u003cgatewayIP\u003e\"` in `~/.config/containers/containers.conf` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\\.config\\containers\\containers.conf` (Windows).\n\n---\n\n### Networking boundaries\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    C[Container\u003cbr/\u003eService bound to 0.0.0.0] \n    B1[Barrier: Podman VM network bridge]\n    VMGW[host.containers.internal\u003cbr/\u003e→ 172.20.x.1 gateway]\n    B2[Barrier: WSL/Podman VM boundary]\n    W[OS Host\u003cbr/\u003eService bound to 0.0.0.0:PORT]\n\n    C -- \"requests → host.containers.internal:PORT\" --\u003e B1\n    B1 --\u003e VMGW\n    VMGW -- \"forwards to 172.20.x.1\" --\u003e B2\n    B2 --\u003e W\n\n    classDef barrier fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 3;\n    class B1,B2 barrier;\n```\n\n---\n\n**Result:** Containers can reliably reach host-side services via `host.containers.internal` on both Windows and macOS, with services inside containers reachable through the Podman VM gateway.\n\nHere\u0027s some code you can use to isolate this to the aspire application:\n\nThis does change all projects and executables to bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost, so beware of that. It’s needed because when an app only listens on localhost, connections arriving from outside the container (via the Podman VM gateway) will be refused. Binding to 0.0.0.0 ensures the service accepts traffic on all interfaces, including the one bridged through host.containers.internal.\n\n**Security implications:\n\nBinding to 0.0.0.0 makes the service accessible on every network interface inside the container. That means if the container’s port is published (e.g., -p 5000:5000), the service will be reachable from your entire host machine (and potentially your LAN, depending on firewall/NAT settings).\n\nThis is generally fine in a local development setup where you control the network and are running against Podman Desktop/WSL.\n\nFor production scenarios, you typically wouldn’t want everything listening on all interfaces. Instead, you’d rely on container network isolation, ingress controllers, or reverse proxies to explicitly expose only what’s needed.**\n\nIn short: this is a pragmatic development-time workaround to make Podman networking behave consistently on Windows/macOS, but it shouldn’t be treated as a best practice for securing production workloads.\n\n\n```C#\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;\n\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting;\n\n/// \u003csummary\u003e\n/// Adds runtime adjustments that make containerized services reachable when running on Windows with Podman.\n/// \u003cpara\u003e\n/// Background: On Windows, Podman runs containers inside a lightweight Linux VM.

(e.g. running one instance through VS, and a second from the command line).\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dashboard.Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host[11]\n      Hosting failed to start\n      System.IO.IOException: Failed to bind to address http://127.0.0.1:4005: address already in use.\n       ---\u003e Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections.AddressInUseException: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.\n       ---\u003e System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (10048): Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.\n         at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.UpdateStatusAfterSocketErrorAndThrowException(SocketError error, Boolean disconnectOnFailure, String callerName)\n         at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.DoBind(EndPoint endPointSnapshot, SocketAddress socketAddress)\n         at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind(EndPoint localEP)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketTransportOptions.CreateDefaultBoundListenSocket(EndPoint endpoint)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketConnectionListener.Bind()\n         --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketConnectionListener.Bind()\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketTransportFactory.BindAsync(EndPoint endpoint, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Infrastructure.TransportManager.BindAsync(EndPoint endPoint, ConnectionDelegate connectionDelegate, EndpointConfig endpointConfig, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerImpl.\u003c\u003ec__DisplayClass28_0`1.\u003c\u003cStartAsync\u003eg__OnBind|0\u003ed.MoveNext()\n      --- End of stack trace from previous location ---\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.BindEndpointAsync(ListenOptions endpoint, AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.BindEndpointAsync(ListenOptions endpoint, AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.LocalhostListenOptions.BindAsync(AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.EndpointsStrategy.BindAsync(AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.BindAsync(ListenOptions[] listenOptions, AddressBindContext context, Func`2 useHttps, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerImpl.BindAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerImpl.StartAsync[TContext](IHttpApplication`1 application, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.GenericWebHostService.StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host.\u003cStartAsync\u003eb__15_1(IHostedService service, CancellationToken token)\n         at Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host.ForeachService[T](IEnumerable`1 services, CancellationToken token, Boolean concurrent, Boolean abortOnFirstException, List`1 exceptions, Func`3 operation)\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dashboard[0]\n      2024-11-13T18:37:13.8250000Z Unhandled exception.

One way to reproduce this is to make the the OTLP port match the applicationUrl in your AppHost\u0027s `launchsettings.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json\",\n  \"profiles\": {\n    \"https\": {\n      \"commandName\": \"Project\",\n      \"dotnetRunMessages\": true,\n      \"launchBrowser\": true,\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:17141;http://localhost:15042\",\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\",\n        \"DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\",\n        \"DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https://localhost:17141\", // Make this match a port used in applicationUrl\n        \"DOTNET_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https://localhost:22138\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen the dashboard app fails to bind to the port, the `LogAndRethrow` method in `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host` catches the exception and logs it to the logging infrastructure which in turn writes to stdout in json. \n `DashboardLifecycleHook.WatchResourceLogsAsync()` is then able to parse this correctly.  However because the exception is also rethrown, it is not caught anywhere else and bubles up until it causes the entire app to crash with an unhandled exception.  At this point, dotnet writes the unhandled exception to stdout, which really mucks up  `DashboardLifecycleHook.WatchResourceLogsAsync()` - with each line of stdout becoming it\u0027s own log entry in the App Host console:\n\n```\ninfo: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Aspire version: 9.0.0+01ed51919f8df692ececce51048a140615dc759d\ninfo: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Distributed application starting.\ninfo: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Application host directory is: S:\\AspireApp1\\AspireApp1.AppHost\ninfo: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Now listening on: https://localhost:17141\ninfo: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Login to the dashboard at https://localhost:17141/login?t=3a5368a91ebf9ec9add892224232667e\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dashboard.Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host[11]\n      Hosting failed to start\n      System.IO.IOException: Failed to bind to address https://127.0.0.1:17141: address already in use.\n       ---\u003e Microsoft.AspNetCore.Connections.AddressInUseException: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.\n       ---\u003e System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (10048): Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.\n         at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.UpdateStatusAfterSocketErrorAndThrowException(SocketError error, Boolean disconnectOnFailure, String callerName)\n         at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.DoBind(EndPoint endPointSnapshot, SocketAddress socketAddress)\n         at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind(EndPoint localEP)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketTransportOptions.CreateDefaultBoundListenSocket(EndPoint endpoint)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketConnectionListener.Bind()\n         --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketConnectionListener.Bind()\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Sockets.SocketTransportFactory.BindAsync(EndPoint endpoint, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.Infrastructure.TransportManager.BindAsync(EndPoint endPoint, ConnectionDelegate connectionDelegate, EndpointConfig endpointConfig, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerImpl.\u003c\u003ec__DisplayClass28_0`1.\u003c\u003cStartAsync\u003eg__OnBind|0\u003ed.MoveNext()\n      --- End of stack trace from previous location ---\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.BindEndpointAsync(ListenOptions endpoint, AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.BindEndpointAsync(ListenOptions endpoint, AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.LocalhostListenOptions.BindAsync(AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.EndpointsStrategy.BindAsync(AddressBindContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.Internal.AddressBinder.BindAsync(ListenOptions[] listenOptions, AddressBindContext context, Func`2 useHttps, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerImpl.BindAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServerImpl.StartAsync[TContext](IHttpApplication`1 application, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.GenericWebHostService.StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n         at Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host.\u003cStartAsync\u003eb__15_1(IHostedService service, CancellationToken token)\n         at Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host.ForeachService[T](IEnumerable`1 services, CancellationToken token, Boolean concurrent, Boolean abortOnFirstException, List`1 exceptions, Func`3 operation)\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dashboard[0]\n      2025-01-03T00:08:53.0630000Z Unhandled exception.

Each host logs and then rethrows the exception causing the first 2 copies of the error.\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/89e329c95ebac571567a58f27bfeb462d8e6b35d/src/Aspire.Hosting/Dashboard/DashboardServiceHost.cs#L201.  The 3rd copy occurs as the exception bubbles up to the `Main` method unhandled, and so the dotnet runtime blows up with an unhandled exception.\n\nThis version can be reproduced by simply running the same app host in two separate console windows:\n\n```\ndotnet run --project S:\\AspireApp1\\AspireApp1.AppHost\\\ndotnet run --project S:\\AspireApp1\\AspireApp1.AppHost\\\n```\n\n```\nUsing launch

Please describe the problem.\n\nWhen using `.WithHttpEndpoint()` Aspire automatically proxies, from an HTTP endpoint to target HTTP endpoint.\n\nWhen using `.WithHttpsEndpoint()` Aspire automatically proxies from an HTTPS endpoint to target HTTP endpoint. In this scenario, it leverages .NET dev cert, which is trusted, a nice to have when working with web apps locally, so the user doesn\u0027t get security alerts.\n\nHowever, there is no way to have an HTTPS endpoing proxying to a target HTTP endpoint. For instance, when serving a web site and working with OAuth, one might need to use HTTPS. \n\nOn Azure, the platform takes care of proxying from HTTPS to HTTP. \nAspire doesn\u0027t offer the same, so one has to implement SSL locally with custom certs, to be created and configured, leading to more work. Another approach is spinning up, only locally, a reverse proxy app/container like stunnel, grok, and similar, to do that, something like this:\n\n```csharp\nvar httpApp = builder\n                 .AddProject\u003cMyApp\u003e()\n                 .WithHttpEndpoint();\n\nvar httpsApp = builder.AddProject\u003cProxy\u003e()\n                 .WithEnvironment(\"TARGET_ENDPOINT\", httpApp.GetEndpoint(\"http\"))\n                 .WithHttpsEndpoint();\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nAllow to map from HTTPS to HTTP, something like\n\n```csharp\nvar httpsApp = builder\n                 .AddProject\u003cMyApp\u003e()\n                 .WithHttpsEndpoint(httpsTarget = false); // the internal endpoint will be http://...\n```\n\nThis way, the HTTPS endpoint will leverage .NET dev cert, and the internal endpoint is a simple HTTP endpoint that doesn\u0027t require and SSL configuration.",

Out of curiosity, is there a reason why you can\u0027t just have everything in a single solution? What people do in similar situations, is to have a single `.sln` file that has all of the projects, and then have multiple solution filter files `.slnf` which can enable people that just want to open a subset of projects to be able to do so. You can find more information on solution filters [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/filtered-solutions?view=vs-2022), but the TL;DR is that they are very small files that just point to a solution, and apply some filters to it so that when you open that file (The .slnf file) with Visual Studio, it looks like if it were a different solution as it only has a subset of projects.\n\nDoing this would allow you to continue working on a subset of projects when needed, but also allow you to fully orchestrate the projects with Aspire when you need to run everything, rebuild and debug.",

        "body":  "I\u0027m finding the logic for when the `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent` is fired to be very confusing.  Take the following code for example:\n\n```cs\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.Services.AddHealthChecks().AddCheck(\"alwaysUnhealthy\", () =\u003e HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy());\n\nvar one = builder.AddContainer(\"one\", \"nginx\").WithHealthCheck(\"alwaysUnhealthy\");\nvar two = builder.AddContainer(\"two\", \"nginx\");\n\n//two.WaitFor(one);\n\nbuilder.Eventing.Subscribe\u003cAfterResourcesCreatedEvent\u003e((evt, ct) =\u003e\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"AfterResourcesCreatedEvent\");\n    Console.Beep();\n    return Task.CompletedTask;\n});\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\nRun this whilst **docker is stopped**, no resoruces are stated but the `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent` does get fired.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dba7d3fd-fb8d-41e5-adff-3f21743431cd)\n\nHowever if you comment out the `//two.WaitFor(one);` line above and run the app (whilst **docker is still not running**), then the `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent` does not get fired.\n\u003cimg width=\"1185\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65bf11ef-124b-487f-b1e0-8fe8da4d88a0\" /\u003e\n\nThe issue here seems to be that when `WaitFor` is used, the `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent` is blocked until all health checks become healthy.  However the runtime availability is handled by a different flow which does not block `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent`.  \n\nFrom my point of view, both the above are essentially the same in both cases the containers are waiting on something else before they can start, and so I\u0027d expect either both cases to raise `AfterResourcesCreatedEvent` or I\u0027d neither to raise the event.  \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6291e61-e71f-462b-aad6-86df5f13fe60)\n\n",

Specifying `.WithEndpointProxySupport(false)` will disable proxying on all endpoints for a given resource. It\u0027s highly recommended to set explicit host ports for your container resources to avoid potential port conflicts as the default behavior for un-proxied container endpoints is to expose the endpoint using the internal port for the container.\n\nWe made the new API experimental and opt-in because there\u0027s additional larger work that will need to happen to unblock enabling the behavior by default, but we wanted to still provide a straightforward workaround in the short term. You can try out the API in nightly builds or the upcoming 9.1 release.",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\n\nThere should be a way to control how the container for a project gets produced in publish mode. Right now the deployment tool (such as azd) uses the manifest sees the project resource and has to infer how that project gets turned into a container image. Docker files are similar, but containers are able to expose build arguments that instruct tools on what values to pass to docker build. We need to same capability for projects.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting;\n\npublic static class ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions\n{\n+    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithBuildProperty\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, string propertyName, string propertyValue) where T: ProjectResource\n+    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithBuildProperty\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, string propertyName,  IResourceBuilder\u003cParameterResource\u003e propertyValue) where T: ProjectResource\n+    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithBuildProperty\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, string propertyName,  ReferenceExpression propertyValue) where T: ProjectResource\n}\n```\n\n```C#\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n\npublic class ProjectBuildAnnotation\n{\n    public Dictionary\u003cstring, object?\u003e BuildArguments { get; } = [];\n}\n```\n\n\nManifest\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"api\": {\n      \"type\": \"project.v1\",\n      \"build\": {\n         \"args\": {\n            \"ContainerImage\": \"{image.value}\"\n         }\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar imageName = builder.AddParameter(\"api-image\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyApi\u003e(\"api\")\n       .WithBuildProperty(\"ContainerImage\", imageName);\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\n## Risks\n\nWe need to make sure that build arguments are applied in all of the places that make sense. Today, the apphost gets built, along with referenced projects before we execute. That might cause some confusion. \n\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eoriginal issue\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nWe deploy microservices via Aspire and Azure Developer CLI (azd). Currently, Aspire does not specify container repository naming conventions or image tags in the service manifests, and Azure Developer CLI (azd) applies default naming conventions:\n\n**Repository name:** {projectName}/{serviceName}-{env}\n**Image tag**: azd-deploy-{clock.now().unix()}\n\n#### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a new Aspire project with a project reference.\n2. Run azd deploy.\n3. Observe that the deployed container image includes:\n  - A repository name in the format {projectName}/{serviceName}-{env}.\n  - An image tag in the format azd-deploy-{clock.now().unix()}.\n4. Reference the deployed container image from another Aspire project\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"deployed-image\", \"{projectName}/{serviceName}-{env}\", \"azd-deploy-{clock.now().unix()}\")\n       .WithImageRegistry(\"myregistry.azurecr.io\");\n```\n\nThis behaviour limits our ability to use semantic versioning and custom repository names for container images. \n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\nI propose adding support in Aspire to allow developers to specify container repository names and image tags directly in the manifest. Aspire should generate the manifest with these options so that azd can use the specified values instead of its defaults.\n\n\n#### Proposed API Changes in Aspire\n\n1. **Add `ContainerPublishingOptionsAnnotation`**  \n   This annotation will store the repository and image tag information.\n\n   ```csharp\n   namespace Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n   internal class ContainerPublishingOptionsAnnotation : IResourceAnnotation\n   {\n       public string? Repository { get; set; }\n       public string? ImageTag { get; set; }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Extension Method to Project Resource Builder**  \n   The extension method enables developers to configure these values.\n\n   ```csharp\n   public static IResourceBuilder\u003cProjectResource\u003e WithContainerPublishingOptions(\n       this IResourceBuilder\u003cProjectResource\u003e builder, \n       string? imageTag, \n       string? repository)\n   {\n       ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(builder);\n\n       ContainerPublishingOptionsAnnotation annotation = new()\n       {\n           ImageTag = imageTag,\n           Repository = repository\n       };\n       builder.Resource.Annotations.Add(annotation);\n       return builder;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify `WriteToProjectAsync` in `ManifestPublishingContext`**  \n   Update the manifest generation logic to include the `config` section if `ContainerPublishingOptionsAnnotation` is present.\n\n   **Updated Code:**\n   ```csharp\n   private async Task WriteProjectAsync(ProjectResource project)\n   {\n       if (!project.TryGetLastAnnotation\u003cIProjectMetadata\u003e(out var metadata))\n       {\n           throw new DistributedApplicationException(\"Project metadata not found.\");\n       }\n\n       var relativePathToProjectFile = GetManifestRelativePath(metadata.ProjectPath);\n\n       if (project.TryGetLastAnnotation\u003cDeploymentTargetAnnotation\u003e(out var deploymentTarget))\n       {\n           Writer.WriteString(\"type\", \"project.v1\");\n       }\n       else\n       {\n           Writer.WriteString(\"type\", \"project.v0\");\n       }\n\n       if (project.TryGetLastAnnotation\u003cContainerPublishingOptionsAnnotation\u003e(out var containerImageAnnotation))\n       {\n           Writer.WriteStartObject(\"config\");\n           if (containerImageAnnotation.ImageTag is not null)\n           {\n               Writer.WriteString(\"containerImageTag\", containerImageAnnotation.ImageTag);\n           }\n           if (containerImageAnnotation.Repository is not null)\n           {\n               Writer.WriteString(\"containerRepository\", containerImageAnnotation.Repository);\n           }\n           Writer.WriteEndObject();\n       }\n\n       Writer.WriteString(\"path\", relativePathToProjectFile);\n\n       if (deploymentTarget is not null)\n       {\n           await WriteDeploymentTarget(deploymentTarget).ConfigureAwait(false);\n       }\n\n       await WriteCommandLineArgumentsAsync(project).ConfigureAwait(false);\n\n       await WriteEnvironmentVariablesAsync(project).ConfigureAwait(false);\n\n       WriteBindings(project);\n   }\n   ```\n#### Manifest changes:\n\n**Current**\n```json\n\"apiservice\": {\n  \"type\": \"project.v1\",\n  \"path\": \"ApiService/ApiService.csproj\",\n  \"deployment\": {\n    \"type\": \"azure.bicep.v0\",\n    \"path\": \"apiservice.module.bicep\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"apiservice_containerimage\": \"{apiservice.containerImage}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n**Updated**\n```json\n\"apiservice\": {\n  \"type\": \"project.v1\",\n  \"path\": \"ApiService/ApiService.csproj\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"containerRepository\": \"my-microservices/apiservice\",\n    \"containerImageTag\": \"v1.2.0;latest\"\n  },\n  \"deployment\": {\n    \"type\": \"azure.bicep.v0\",\n    \"path\": \"apiservice.module.bicep\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"apiservice_containerimage\": \"{apiservice.containerImage}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\nThis would permit developers to do the following:\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.ApiService\u003e(\"apiservice\")\n       .WithContainerPublishingOptions(\"v1.2.0;latest\", \"my-microservices/apiservice\")\n```\nand then reference the deployed container image in a separate project as\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"deployed-image\", \"my-microservices/apiservice\", \"v1.2.0\")\n       .WithImageRegistry(\"myregistry.azurecr.io\");\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nCurrently, azd generates the container image name using the following logic:\n\n```go\nimageName := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%s\",\n    at.containerHelper.DefaultImageName(serviceConfig),\n    at.containerHelper.DefaultImageTag())\n```\n\nThis applies default values for the image repository and tag. To support configurable options for `containerImageTags` and `containerRepository`, azd would need a corresponding change such as:\n\n```go\ncontainerImageTags := at.containerHelper.DefaultImageTag()\nif serviceConfig.Config[\"containerImageTags\"] != nil {\n    containerImageTags = serviceConfig.Config[\"containerImageTags\"].(string)\n}\n\ncontainerRepository := at.containerHelper.DefaultImageName(serviceConfig)\nif serviceConfig.Config[\"containerRepository\"] != nil {\n    containerRepository = serviceConfig.Config[\"containerRepository\"].(string)\n}\n\nimageName := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%s\", containerRepository, containerImageTags)\n```\n\nThis change would allow azd to read the custom values defined in the Aspire-generated manifest under the `config` section, enabling developers to override the defaults with their desired repository names and semantic version tags.\n\n\nThe selection of \"config\" as the manifest property is driven by the existing azd ServiceConfig type which defines:\n\n```go\n// Custom configuration for the service target\n\tConfig map[string]any `yaml:\"config,omitempty\"`\n```\n**Final Notes**:  \nThese changes will:\n- Enable semantic versioning for microservices, improving maintainability.\n- Provide developers with control over repository naming conventions to align with organizational standards.\n- Allow seamless reuse of container images across multiple projects by supporting explicit repository and tag references.\n\nThese updates align with azd\u0027s existing `ServiceConfig` structure, leveraging its `config` property for container customization. I am happy to contribute the necessary code changes.\n\n\u003c/details\u003e",

        "body":  "**EDIT: After researching the problem more extensively, I changed the title of this issue from \"Question - how to know the URL assigned to a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app\" to \"Aspire launches the client of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app on a different random port every time the AppHost is started\".\n\nThe below is how my question was originally worded, but the root cause and the steps to reproduce are in my comment of 15th January.**\n\nSome time ago, Bossman Dan Roth [reported here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/18612), that the URL (e.g. `localhost:xxxxx`) of a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app \"should be generated randomly by Visual Studio\". That issue has been resolved and that\u0027s certainly what\u0027s happening on my machine. Perfect.\n\nMy question is, how can I determine what URL will be (or has been) assigned by Visual Studio, please?\n\nI either need to control the URL (set it myself in launchSettings or my Aspire AppHost) or I need to read it (from either the Blazor server project or my Aspire AppHost) once it has been assigned by Visual Studio. I don\u0027t mind which.\n\n**The use case**\nMy hosted Blazor WebAssembly app is a client of a Web API. The client\u0027s URL should get listed in the Web API\u0027s CORS configuration. For example (in the web API)\n\n```\n// Get a list of clients allowed to access the Web API.\nvar clients = builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"Clients\").Get\u003cstring[]\u003e() ?? [];\n// Getting the URL of the Blazor server app was easy using existing Aspire features. Hopefully I can figure out how to get the Blazor WebAssembly app onto this list too.\n\nbuilder.Services.AddCors(options =\u003e\n{\n    options.AddDefaultPolicy(policy =\u003e\n    {\n        policy.WithOrigins(clients); // Allow the list of clients to access the Web API\n        policy.AllowAnyMethod();\n        policy.WithHeaders(\"X-Requested-With\");\n        policy.AllowCredentials();\n    });\n});\n```\nI thought perhaps it could be set in the launchSettings.json file of the client app, like this:\n```\n{\n  \"profiles\": {\n    \"Blazor.Client\": {\n      \"commandName\": \"Project\",\n      \"launchBrowser\": true,\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:7279;http://localhost:5279\",\n      \"launchUrl\": \"https://localhost:7279/Counter\",\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nBut the content of that file seems to be ignored by Visual Studio when launching a Blazor WebAssembly app. Can anybody point me in the correct direction please? How do I know the URL at which my Blazor WASM app is going to run early enough in the app lifecycle that I can add it as a client of the web API?",

And thanks for your interest, @Bellarmine-Head!\n\nYou might need to help me understand your second suggestion:\n\n\u003e how about just loading the solution into VS, hitting F5 and seeing what the URL is in the browser?\n\nIf I see what the URL is in the browser, it will be too late to add the address as a client of the Web API. Besides, it will  be different next time the app starts up. Maybe I didn\u0027t understand what you meant.\n\nThe first suggestion has got me thinking though:\n\n\u003e ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fd8d58-40be-4584-b6a2-91f7d06c30b4)\n\nYour screenshot is the launchsettings.json is from a Blazor Server Project. If I could get the client to be run at the same URL as specified here, that would get me  unstuck, but my WebAssembly client is being served at a different localhost port every time I boot up the app, no matter what I put in launchsettings.json. In another app, I see this working. Maybe that\u0027s the root cause of my problem.\n\nI\u0027ve been doing a bit more research into this today and I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s something to do with Aspire. The client and server of a hosted blazor web app share the same localhost address. But if you add them to an Aspire project, the server app\u0027s address (taken from launchsettings.json) is no longer the same as the client\u0027s (which is randomly generated).",

(Incidentally, I\u0027m rather enjoying playing with Aspire, but it isn\u0027t Blazor-friendly yet, it would seem). I\u0027m sure because:\n\n1. If I create a new Blazor Web App with a Server and Client project, and leave the Server app as the startup project, it works fine (that is, it will be launched at the localhost port specified in `launchsettings.json`).\n2. If I then right-click on the server project and go to _Add_ \u003e _.NET Aspire Orchestrator Support_, I get an `AppHost` project now set as the startup project. Run that, and the Aspire dashboard shows the Blazor server project running at the correct localhost address from its `launchsettings.json`. However, the browser window that opens shows the app running on a random port that changes every time the project starts up.\n\nThat\u0027s the root cause.\nBy the way, I found your links very interesting and agree strongly with you and bossman Steve Sanderson on that!",

Please describe the problem.\n\nIn .NET 9.1 `dotnet run` gains two new launch options that would be useful for launching projects in the context of an Aspire app:\n\n1. `-e` causes an environment variable to be applied to the application being launched, but NOT to the targets participating in the application build (unlike the old `env:` option).\n\n2. `--no-launch-profile-arguments` allows to ignore invocation arguments in launch profiles\n\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45844 for an example how these options are used in the context of `dotnet watch`\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIdeally these options would be used to launch projects when Aspire app host is launched from command line via `dotnet run`. The problem is they are only available in .NET 9.1 and newer. So either Aspire app host needs to somehow learn what `dotnet` CLI version is available and change the launch options used accordingly, or start using these new launch options only after .NET 9.1 or later becomes a required dependency for Aspire.\n\n### Additional context\n\n@DamianEdwards FYI",

The redirect URL needs to be the right url in a given context and we have no way of resolving the url based on the context.

        "body":  "## Problem\n\nPersistent lifetime relies on checking the state of the resources to detect if it can reuse an existing instance or start a fresh one. This state uses things like ENVs, volume mounts, parameters, ... Any changed value between two runs will require a restart.\n\nSome resources are coded in a way that make it impossible to be persistent. Here are some things that I found while working on [Azure Service Bus resource](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/7071), but this is definitely not the whole list of potential issues:\n- The emulator requires a sql resource. The lifetime state was not forwarded to this container and it would then be re-created. Sub-resources should be applied the same lifetime.\n- A random password was generated every time for the sub-resource, invalidating the previous hash. The solution was to store the password in user secrets and reuse it if it exists.\n- A file mount needed to be created to host the custom configuration for the emulator. A new file in a random temporary folder was created, invalidating the hash. The solution was to store the path to this resource.\n\n[Suggest other constraints]\n\n## Suggestions\n\nThese problems will be common to most resources. Here are some proposals that should help mitigate state changes between restarts.\n\n### Temporary files\n\nTemporary file names should be deterministically found. This means not using random folders or file names. And the file name should be based on a hash of the content such that we get a new file when its content changes. (and reuse the same file if the content is the same).\n\nExamples:\n- `%TEMP%/AzureServiceBus-{resourceName}-{contentHash}.Config.Json`\n- `%TEMP%/AzureServiceBus-{resourceName}.Config.Json/{contentHash}`\n\n### Storing files in the app\u0027s `/bin` directory\n\nStoring files in the temp folder without context could lead to conflicts between applications (same resource types and names). These files can\u0027t be cleaned though. Using the `/bin` folder of each app would mean they have the same lifetime as the app. Would be cleaned using `git clean` too.\n\n### Use the Secret Store folder\n\nRight now the easiest way to store data for an application across runs is to use the Secret Store. Generated Password Parameters are already using it. It requires the creation of a unique identifier in the csproj. And option could be to use it for other things than app secrets.\n\n`%AppData%/Microsoft/UserSecrets`\n\n`./secrets.json`\n\n### Using the user profile (Aspire Store)\n\n`%AppData%/Aspire/[AssemblyIdentifier/Hash]/store.json`\n\nProvide the same functionality as the user Secrets Store but isolated from it: \n- Not mixing secrets with data that just require cross-runs storage\n- Not requiring a guid in the csproj (could be an assembly attribute of a hash of the assembly location).\n\n### Potential useful methods\n\nOn top of the functionalities provided by the existing [`SecretsStore.cs`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/src/Shared/SecretsStore.cs) these could be useful:\n```\nstring GetAspireStoreFolder();\nstring GetOrCreateFileWithContent(string path, byte[] contentHash);\n```\n",

That will only work if the container is watching for file changes, so it might be an opt-in enhancement.

I\u0027d like us to avoid adding files to the artifacts or intermediate output directories that aren\u0027t correctly tracked by the build as I find it super annoying when `dotnet clean` isn\u0027t enough to reset relevant state.\n\nStoring non-secret stuff in the user secrets directory just seems confusing.\n\nSo I vote for standardizing on storing stable files like this (those intended to be re-used across launches) in `~/.aspire/`, with the directory being based on the app host name and path hash, e.g.:\n\n```csharp\nvar appName = Sanitize(builder.Environment.ApplicationName).ToLowerInvariant();\nvar appNameHash = builder.Configuration[\"AppHost:Sha256\"]![..10].ToLowerInvariant();\nvar dirName = $\"{appName}.{appNameHash}\";\nvar dirPath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile), \".aspire\", dirName);\n// Results in path like: `~/.aspire/my_aspireapp.apphost.236f2386i0`\n```\n\nIn cases where the file needs to be updated based on content changes, the file name should include a hash based on the relevant content (to @sebastienros\u0027 point), e.g. `~/.aspire/my_aspireapp.apphost.236f2386i0/some-content-asdlkjasdoierjoaisdj.xxx`",

Even if `dotnet clean` did not clean some of the dev-time assets (but `git clean` did), I would say it is a much more acceptable niusance compared to `rm -rf ~/code/myAppFolder` still leaving some stuff related to \"myApp\" p on the file system.\n\n",

Should we just write these files out to a sub-directory next to the app host project assembly? We don\u0027t currently embed the path to bin or obj in the assembly (only the project path) so if we want to go anywhere other than under the app host runtime assembly we\u0027ll need to update our targets to flow that info. Do folks see any issue with writing files out to this location at runtime?\n\nOne issue I can think of with putting it in /bin is that now the file is considered part of the app output and might be included if the app output is copied anywhere, i.e. \"deployed\". This doesn\u0027t really apply to the app host today but it still feels icky. I think ideally these would be in /obj?\n\n@sebastienros @eerhardt ",

The downsides to this is yet another folder to add to all the `.gitignore` files of repos that have Aspire apps. But maybe that is acceptable? There might not even be a problem if people check these generated files into source control if the file name and contents are deterministic given the same AppHost code.",

Eg, to configure port randomization during testing, dashboard disablement, resource suffixes, etc.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- `DcpPublisher:ContainerRuntimeInitializationTimeout`\n- `DcpPublisher:RandomizePorts`\n- `DcpPublisher:DeleteResourcesOnShutdown`\n- `DcpPublisher:ResourceNameSuffix`\n- `ASPNETCORE_URLS` (for the AppHost dashboard URL)\n- `DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL`\n\n## Proposed API\n\nExpose these properties via `DistributedApplicationOptions`, which is passed in to `DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(DistributedApplicationOptions)` and which is available via the various testing builder creation API overloads on \u0027DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder`.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease provide code examples that highlight how the proposed API additions are meant to be consumed.\nThis will help suggest whether the API has the right shape to be functional, performant and useable.\nYou can use code blocks like this:\n```csharp\n// some lines of code here\n```\n--\u003e\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n\u003c!--\nWere there other options you considered, such as alternative API shapes?\nHow does this compare to analogous APIs in other ecosystems and libraries?\n--\u003e\n\n## Risks\n\n\u003c!--\nPlease mention any risks that to your knowledge the API proposal might entail, such as breaking changes, performance regressions, etc.\n--\u003e\n",

A consequence is that if another resource is set to `WaitForCompletion` it\u0027ll start as if the referenced project was gracefully finished.\n\nApp1 is finished with an exception:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a4c03a-4149-490c-b3e0-0a19a159cf41)\n\nApp2 is started even if the completion exited with error:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ae963ad-54f7-4ac9-bdf5-e091e31ad7e8)\n\nThe AppHost is very simple:\n```csharp\nvar app1 = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.ConsoleApp1\u003e(\"app1\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.ConsoleApp2\u003e(\"app2\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WaitForCompletion(app1);\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe DCP should keep track of the debug exit code instead of marking the resource as Finished without errors.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRepro project: https://github.com/arielmoraes/AspireFinishedStateError\n\nI\u0027ve just created the full Aspire template with two simple console app.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.102\n Commit:            cb83cd4923\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.4a54b1a6\n MSBuild version:   17.12.18+ed8c6aec5\n\nAmbiente de runtime:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.102\\\n\nCargas de trabalho do .NET instaladas:\n [aspire]\n   Origem da Instalação: VS 17.12.35707.178\n   Versão do Manifesto:    8.2.2/8.0.100\n   Caminho do Manifesto:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\8.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.aspire\\8.2.2\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Tipo de Instalação:              Msi\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nUsing Visual Studio with Aspire 9.0.0 and ASP.NET Core 9",

The source is in this comment from 5 years ago https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35599#issuecomment-621954472. \n\nI have no clue what the quirk they refer to is, but returning an exit code different than 0 from main makes Aspire work as intended.\n\nDon\u0027t know if there is something Aspire can do about that, as it\u0027s up to the application to choose which exit code to return. If the application handles using the unhandled exception event it has a chance to also set the exit code.\n\nSo, the only problem is not handling an exception while debugging in VS.",

I\u0027m on Windows 11 running Docker Desktop v4.38.0. Not sure where to go from here and curious why `Kubernetes Container` is in the error message? My searching hasn\u0027t turned up anything obvious to me and I\u0027m not sure what it\u0027s trying to authenticate to. \n\nI tried running `dotnet dev-certs https --clean` and `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect project to run without errors and to be able to access the Aspire dashboard.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nScaffold new project and attempt to run it.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\ninfo: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Aspire version: 9.0.0+01ed51919f8df692ececce51048a140615dc759d\ninfo:

Adding localhost/127.0.0.1 to the NO_PROXY environment variable got Aspire is more of a workaround for an improperly configured proxy routing setup that isn’t already excluding localhost traffic. ",

The two primary scenarios that could cause that check in the KubernetesClient library to fail would be a mismatch between the NotBefore/NotAfter settings for the certificate and the current system clock or a mismatch between the subject name of the certificate and the address it was actually requested for (the certificate has its subject name set to the loopback address that the orchestration layer is running on).

        "body":  "This is related to my pull request here: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/7162\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\n.NET Aspire doesn\u0027t currently (as of early 2025) facilitate a Blazor WebAssembly (client) app discovering Aspire resources, even if the app has been added to the distributed application, because Blazor WebAssembly apps run in the browser and are \"standalone\". This has been commented on here:\n\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/4785\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/1536\n- https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6781\n\nI suppose Microsoft\u0027s expectation was that client apps (including Blazor WASM clients and any SPAs) will need to be aware of the web APIs they\u0027re supposed to call and that they will store these in `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.{environmentName}.json` without relying on Aspire. This works fine, but if the endpoint changes, or if it differs in your development and production environments, you have to manage those changes in your client app as well as your other resources. This is the kind of problem Aspire is intended to solve (and does so exceedingly well, apart from Blazor). These changes to Aspire will achieve that.\n\nThis proposal would integrate my [Nuget package Aspire4Wasm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire4Wasm/) ([source code here](https://github.com/BenjaminCharlton/Aspire4Wasm)) into Aspire (with the addition of only 5 new classes and 2 interfaces, and changing none of the existing ones).\n\nThe changes allow an Aspire `AppHost` to define web APIs that a Blazor app can access, and pass that service discovery information to the app by writing to its `appsettings.{environment}.json` files.\n\n## Proposed API\n\nYou can see the diffs I\u0027m proposing here: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/7162/files\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nIn your Aspire AppHost project\u0027s Program.cs file:\n\n1. Add the Web Api projects you want your client to be able to call with the existing  `AddProject` method\n2. Add your Blazor Server app with `AddProject` method then chain a call to the new `AddWebAssemblyClient` to add your client app.\n3. Then chain a call to `WithReference` to point the client to each web API (you can repeat this for as many Web APIs as you need)\n\nIn your WebAssembly client\u0027s `Program.cs` file:\n\n1. Call `AddServiceDiscovery`\n2. Configure your `HttpClient`s either globally or one at a time. In each client\u0027s `BaseAddress` property, use the name you gave to the resource in your AppHost and Aspire\u0027s `https+http://` syntax.\n\nSee the example below:\n\n### Example Program.cs in AppHost\n```\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar inventoryApi = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.AspNetCoreWebApi\u003e(\"inventoryapi\");\nvar billingApi = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.SomeOtherWebApi\u003e(\"billingapi\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Blazor\u003e(\"blazorServer\")\n    .AddWebAssemblyClient\u003cProjects.Blazor_Client\u003e(\"blazorWasmClient\")\n    .WithReference(inventoryApi)\n    .WithReference(billingApi);\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n### Example Program.cs in your Blazor WebAssembly Client\nInstall (on the WebAssembly client) the `Microsoft.Extensions.ServiceDiscovery` Nuget package to get the official Aspire service discovery functionality that is going to read your resource information from your app settings. Then add the code below:\n```\nbuilder.Services.AddServiceDiscovery();\nbuilder.Services.ConfigureHttpClientDefaults(static http =\u003e\n{\n    http.AddServiceDiscovery();\n});\n\nbuilder.Services.AddHttpClient\u003cIInventoryService, InventoryService\u003e(\n    client =\u003e\n    {\n        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"https+http://inventoryapi\"); // The syntax for service discovery in Aspire will now work!\n    });\n\n    builder.Services.AddHttpClient\u003cIBillingService, BillingService\u003e(\n    client =\u003e\n    {\n        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"https+http://billingapi\"); // The syntax for service discovery in Aspire will now work!\n    });\n```\n\n## Default behaviour\nUsing the default behaviour (in the example) your AppHost will write the service discovery information for all the referenced resources into the `appsettings.{environmentName}.json` file of your client app for you.\nIt uses the following structure. The structure is important because it allows Aspire to \"discover\" the information on the client.\n```\n{\n  \"Services\": {\n    \"inventoryapi\": {\n      \"https\": [\n        \"https://localhost:1234\"\n      ],\n      \"http\": [\n        \"http://localhost:4321\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"billingapi\": {\n      \"https\": [\n        \"https://localhost:9876\"\n      ],\n      \"http\": [\n        \"http://localhost:6789\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n## Custom behaviours (optional)\nIf you want to serialize the service discovery information some other way in your WebAssembly application (for example, in a different JSON file, or in an XML file) you can do so in the AppHost `Program.cs` by creating a custom implementation of `IServiceDiscoveryInfoSerializer` and passing it to the call to `AddWebAssemblyClient` via the `WebAssemblyProjectBuilderOptions` class, like this:\n```\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar inventoryApi = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.AspNetCoreWebApi\u003e(\"inventoryapi\");\nvar billingApi = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.SomeOtherWebApi\u003e(\"billingapi\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Blazor\u003e(\"blazorServer\")\n    .AddWebAssemblyClient\u003cProjects.Blazor_Client\u003e(\"blazorWasmClient\" options =\u003e {\n        options.ServiceDiscoveryInfoSerializer = yourImplementation;\n    })\n    .WithReference(inventoryApi)\n    .WithReference(billingApi);\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\nIf you choose to make a custom implementation of `IServiceDiscoveryInfoSerializer`, you only need to override one method:\n```\npublic void SerializeServiceDiscoveryInfo(IResourceWithServiceDiscovery resource) { }\n```\nNote: If you choose to override the default behaviour with an output format that Aspire can\u0027t read from your WebAssembly client app, you\u0027ll also need to override the discovery behaviour on the client, which is outside the scope of what I\u0027ve developed here.\n## Using service discovery to configure CORS in your web API (optional)\nYou can also reference one or more Blazor apps from a web API. One use case would be to configure Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the web API to grant access to your clients to submit HTTP requests.\n(Note: None of this section below demonstrates my changes to the existing API of Aspire; it\u0027s just a use case demonstrating how the existing functionality can be leveraged to make use of my proposed changes.)\n### Example updated Program.cs in AppHost project\n```\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar blazorServer = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.InMyCountry_UI_Server\u003e(\"blazorServer\");\n\nvar webApi = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.InMyCountry_WebApi\u003e(\"inventoryApi\")\n .WithReference(blazorServer) // This will pass the endpoint URL of the Blazor app to the web API so that it can be added as a trusted origin in CORS.\n .WaitFor(blazorServer);\n\nblazorServer.AddWebAssemblyClient\u003cProjects.InMyCountry_UI_Client\u003e(\"blazorWasmClient\") // Now we can add the Blazor WebAssembly (client) app in the Aspire4Wasm package.\n    .WithReference(webApi); // And pass the Blazor client a reference to the web API\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n### The example above will add the following to the appsettings{.Environment}.json file of the web API project\n```\n{\n  \"Clients\": [\n    \"https://{url of your blazor app should be here}\"\n  ]\n}\n\n```\nIt should add as many clients as you configured in the AppHost.\n### Example continued in Program.cs in the web API project\nNow that the web API has a reference to the Blazor app in appsettings, we can configure CORS like this:\n```\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddServiceDefaults();\n\nvar clients = builder.Configuration.GetSection(\"Clients\").Get\u003cstring[]\u003e() ?? []; // Get the clients from the list in appsettings.\n\nbuilder.Services.AddCors(options =\u003e\n{\n    options.AddDefaultPolicy(policy =\u003e\n    {\n        policy.WithOrigins(clients); // Add the clients as allowed origins for cross origin resource sharing.\n        policy.AllowAnyMethod();\n        policy.WithHeaders(\"X-Requested-With\");\n        policy.AllowCredentials();\n    });\n});\n\n// Etc.\n```\n## Troubleshooting\nThese are just a few things that I noticed helped me and I hope they help you too.\n* You don\u0027t need a `launchsettings.json` in your webassembly client project. The one in your Blazor server project will do.\n* In the `launchsettings.json` of your blazor server project, I recommend that you set `launchBrowser` to `false`. This means that when the Aspire dashboard opens up, you\u0027ll need to click the link to open up your Blazor client. This is good! If you don\u0027t do this, your Blazor client is going to launch on a random port chosen by Aspire. When launched on a random port, your web API might reject the requests of your Blazor client because it doesn\u0027t have the expected origin to comply with the API\u0027s CORS policy. I tried to stop this happening but couldn\u0027t, so this is my workaround.\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nI considered various names for the method. I preferred simply `AddProject` like the others, but that is taken. I considered `AddClientApp` and `AddBlazorWasm` and `AddBlazorWebAssemblyClient` but I settled on `AddWebAssemblyClient`.\n\nI considered other names for `IServiceDiscoveryInfoSerializer` and its method `SerializeServiceDiscoveryInfo`. For example `AppSettingsWriter` and `WriteServiceJson`. I chose those names because they weren\u0027t wedded to JSON, XML or any other means of writing the service discovery information to the client app.\n\n## Risks\n\nThese changes will not make the Aspire developer experience with Blazor totally seamless. For example, although it\u0027s been great for my hosted Blazor WebAssembly app, I haven\u0027t got it to work with stand-alone Blazor WebAssembly apps yet. I haven\u0027t figured out how to stop the app launching on a random port as well as the one specified in `launchsettings.json` but I get around this by setting `launchBrowser` to false in the Blazor server app\u0027s `launchSettings.json`.\n\nHowever, this is a step in the right direction and will help make Aspire a bit more Blazor-friendly. If you want to see what it does and doesn\u0027t do before accepting the changes, try the Nuget package Aspire4Wasm (version 3.0.0 at the time of writing).",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\n\n`ReferenceExpressionBuilder` is a really useful way of building up a longer reference expression when you may need to encode multiple distinct values into a single environment variable.\n\n```cs\nvar expression = new ReferenceExpressionBuilder();\nexpression.AppendLiteral(\"user=admin;\")\nexpression.Append($\"host={endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Host)};\")\nexpression.Append($\"port={endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port)};\")\nreturn expression.Build();\n```\n\nWhilst the API works, it would be a lot more convenient if the API could used in a fluent manner, simplifying the above to:\n\n```cs\nreturn new ReferenceExpressionBuilder();\n   .AppendLiteral(\"user=admin;\")\n   .Append($\"host={endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Host)};\")\n   .Append($\"port={endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port)};\")\n   .Build();\n```\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\npublic class ReferenceExpressionBuilder\n{\n-    public void Append([InterpolatedStringHandlerArgument(\"\")] in ReferenceExpressionBuilderInterpolatedStringHandler handler)\n+    public ReferenceExpressionBuilder Append([InterpolatedStringHandlerArgument(\"\")] in ReferenceExpressionBuilderInterpolatedStringHandler handler)\n-    public void AppendLiteral(string value)\n+    public ReferenceExpressionBuilder AppendLiteral(string value)\n-    public void AppendFormatted(string? value)\n+    public ReferenceExpressionBuilder AppendFormatted(string? value)\n-    public void AppendFormatted\u003cT\u003e(T valueProvider) where T : IValueProvider, IManifestExpressionProvider\n+    public ReferenceExpressionBuilder AppendFormatted\u003cT\u003e(T valueProvider) where T : IValueProvider, IManifestExpressionProvider\n}\n```\n\nThis changes each `void` method into returning `ReferenceExpressionBuilder`.  Each method\u0027s implementation would remain the same as the old version but with the addition of `return this;` at the end of each method to support a fluent api.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```cs\nreturn new ReferenceExpressionBuilder();\n   .Append($\"foo,\")\n   .Append($\"bar\")\n   .Build();\n```\n\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nNo alternative designs considered.  This new design mirrors `StringBuilder`\u0027s fluent API.\n\n## Risks\n\nThis is an API breaking change by changing the method return types from void to `ReferenceExpressionBuilder `",

Please describe the problem.\n\nI\u0027ve had a few collegues needing to do things with `ReferenceExpression` which don\u0027t work because they unintentionally worked the ReferenceExpression into a regular interpolated string e.g.\n\n```cs\nkafka.WithEnvironment(\"KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS\",\n         $\"PLAINTEXT://localhost:29092,\" +\n         $\"PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:{kafka.GetEndpoint(\"primary\").Property(EndpointProperty.Port)}\")},\" +\n```\n\nWhich fails because the reference expression ultimately ends up being serialized as the literal string `Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ReferenceExpression` rather than the desired port \n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIt would be nice if we could do something to make these errors more obvious.  A few possibiliteis off the top of my head\n\n1. Have `ReferenceExpression.ToString()` throw an error - it seems like you should only ever stringify a reference expression with `.GetValueAsync()` or `.ValueExpression`, and never `.ToString()`.  Would probaby require adding `[DebuggerDisplay(\"{ValueExpression}\")]` to stop the debugger complaining\n\n2. An analyser that detects when `ReferenceExpression` is used inside an interpolated string that isn\u0027t itself used in an interpolated expression, and produce a compiler warning.\n\nFirst option is the easier implementation, but having `.ToString()` throw could feels sketchy - e.g. what if a `ReferenceExpression` ever ends up being passed to a logging framework.\n\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

However, I do feel like it would be a great feature if its achievable.\n\nLet\u0027s say I have the following:\n\n* AppHost\n* ServiceDefaults\n* Class library \"A\"\n* Web project \"B\" (depends on \"A\" + ServiceDefaults)\n* Web project \"C\" (depends on ServiceDefaults)\n\nIf I start-with-debugging and change something that cannot be hot reloaded in \"C\", theoretically the service could be stopped, rebuilt, and restarted without having to rebuild/restart the app host and all of the other projects.\n\nAdmittedly, dependencies make this even more complex (changes to \"A\" rebuilds/restarts \"B\" but not \"C\", changes to \"ServiceDefaults\" rebuilds/restarts all projects but not AppHost, etc) but the resulting developer experience improvements would be fantastic.\n\n### Additional context\n\nTo avoid this being closed as a duplicate, I want to clarify how this issue differs from several existing ones:\n\n#295 Involves the developer manually stopping/starting services. This issue is about Visual Studio working with Aspire to automate the stop/rebuild/start cycle of impacted projects _only_.\n\n#923 Involves keeping specific resources running after shutdown, with a specific focus on containers and/or other \"not my code\" resources.",

The way we\u0027ve done that is to bind mount a custom entrypoint script and set it as the entrypoint for the container. It might end up that we need all these mechanisms be supported to fully support any container, but we intend to start out with focused on containers that already support setting environment variables to inject certificates.",

Should we reverse the handshake here and connect the other way? Should each app host create a socket in a well known path which the CLI can use the find the right apphost?\n\nWhat security concerns are there here?",

The resources hang in a waiting state.\n\nYou can click the `Start` action on one of the resources in a loop to start a resource, and then other resources are able to startup, but it\u0027s still an odd thing to configure. If you wanted that behavior then the right way to do it is have resources waiting on a resource with explicit start configured.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThrow error on startup.

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\nIf an Aspire `AppHost` needs to particular sequence involving a Node script, this can be problematic.\n\nAllow the state of a resource that is effectively a watch process without an exit to be affected by output text. The desired capability is similar to [`problemMatcher` in VS Code tasks that define an \"endsPattern\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_background-watching-tasks)\n\nToday if you run a Node app (eg. `ng serve`) it seems to prematurely indicate \"readiness\" while it\u0027s still executing. Any output indicating \"readiness\" is highly variable in nature due to script customizations and frameworks.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n`IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e` extension\n\n`WaitFor(IResourceBuilder\u003cIResource\u003e dependency, string message)`\n`WaitForWithMessage(IResourceBuilder\u003cIResource\u003e dependency, string message)`\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\n// ng serve / watch\nvar angularClient = builder.AddNpmApp(\"client\", \"./apps/client1\", \"start\");\n\n// something to run only after npm project ready\nvar otherThing = builder.AddNpmApp(\"otherThing\", \"./apps/client2\", \"start\")\n    .WaitForWithMessage(angularClient, \"bundle generation complete\");\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n## Risks",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nOur team uses main codespaces for an easy 1 click development enviroment. Asipre has been great so far but we still get daily hicups which forces us to destroy and recreate the codespace, sometimes multiple times per day.\n\nI\u0027ll create a separate issue for the problems we\u0027re getting. Other issue at #8244.\n\nThis one happens when during the day the vscode client that\u0027s running the codespace might have to be reloaded (Internet loss, codespace timeout, vscode update, etc), when connecting back to the codespace sometimes the Aspire processes never stopped but you don\u0027t have the debug controls available for the Aspire project.\n\nIn this case when you start the AppHost you get\n\n```\n System.IO.IOException: Failed to bind to address https://127.0.0.1:22010: address already in use.\n```\n\nThe process to start the App host crashes and all the silent processes keep running. Then the only options to fix this is to hunt down all the aspire processes to kill them or destroy and create the codespace again.\n\nWe ended up having to create a command alias \u0027killaspire\u0027 to look up all the processes for aspire and our projects and kill them so that we don\u0027t have to recreate the codespace so often.\n\nIn this issue, no processes show on the VsCode debug call stack\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/553dcf5b-9cd4-472d-9f92-fd8df26d2d74)\n\nYou get no debug controls but you can see the processes running on the \"Ports\" section\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef4e5b2-bec6-4ffd-864e-cb2adc1688e4)\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf the vscode window is reloaded, it should either:\n- Ideally show the current process Debug controls if it\u0027s still running.\n- Or the prior Aspire processes be terminated when we run the App Host again\n\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nLeft all my devcontainer config in #8244 \n\nFor this issue I managed to replicate it by:\n\n1. Running the App Host\n2. Force closing the VsCode window to simulate a reload or internet loss conectivity\n3. Connecting the codespace again via the VsCode client (At this point in the ports section you can see all of the running processes)\n4. Running the AppHost again to see the port already in use errors.\n\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```shell\nwarn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServer[9]\n      The ASP.NET Core developer certificate is only trusted by some clients.

However, when I try to access it using its container name, the service cannot be resolved.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect to be able to access services that are hosted in Docker containers by referencing them using their container names within my Aspire application.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIn apphost i add container to builder\n```csharpIn apphost i add container to builder\n```csharp\nvar openwebui = builder.AddContainer(\"openwebui\", \"ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui\", \"latest\")\n        .WithHttpEndpoint(3000, 8080, \"openwebui\");\n\nvar opnweb = openwebui.GetEndpoint(\"openwebui\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.BlazorApp\u003e(\"frontend\")\n    .WithReference(opnweb);\n```\n\nIn Blazor app, Program cs file, I add this\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddServiceDefaults();\n\nbuilder.Services.AddHttpClient(\"openwebui\", client =\u003e\n{\n    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"http+https://openwebui\");\n});\n```\n\nBut every time I tried to access through HttpFactoryClient, i having error address not found\nHere i tried to get access to openwebui\n\n```csharp\n@page \"/counter\"\n@rendermode InteractiveServer\n@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory\n\n\u003cPageTitle\u003eCounter\u003c/PageTitle\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eCounter\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp role=\"status\"\u003eCurrent count: @models\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbutton class=\"btn btn-primary\" @onclick=\"IncrementCount\"\u003eClick me\u003c/button\u003e\n\n@code {\n    private string models = \"\";\n\n    private async Task IncrementCount()\n    {\n        using var http = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(\"openwebui\");\n        var response = await http.GetAsync(\"api/models\");\n        models = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nWhen i try to get access to opnweb, to get Host or Port i having error\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: The endpoint `openwebui` is not allocated for the resource `openwebui`.\n   at Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.EndpointReference.get_AllocatedEndpoint() in /_/src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/EndpointReference.cs:line …\n```\n\nbut in environment variables it shows services__openwebui__openwebui__0\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nSystem.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: No such host is known.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf a failure occurs whilst pulling an image (e.g. incorrect image name, tag doesn\u0027t exist, authentication failures), no logs show up in the console logs\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d11125e2-ad06-4507-9920-506290372511)\n\nSecondly, it takes Aspire a surprisingly long time to move from `Starting` to `Failed to start` state.  `docker run mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/does/not/exist:latest` takes me roughly 300ms.  Aspire takes 10+seconds before failing.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI\u0027d expect to see the error you get if you do `docker run mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/does/not/exist:latest`\n\n```\nUnable to find image \u0027mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/does/not/exist:latest\u0027 locally\nError response from daemon: manifest for mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/does/not/exist:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest tagged by \"latest\" is not found\n``` \n\nI\u0027d also expect the container to move to `FailedToStart` state almost instantly (i.e. similar time to `docker run` takes to fail)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```cs\n    builder.AddContainer($\"quick-exit\", \"mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps\", \"9.0\");\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\nReproed using daily builds\n\n```xml\n  \u003cSdk Name=\"Aspire.AppHost.Sdk\" Version=\"9.2.0-preview.1.25176.5\" /\u003e\n  \u003cPackageReference Include=\"Aspire.Hosting.AppHost\" Version=\"9.2.0-preview.1.25176.5\" /\u003e\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\nInterestingly if you restart the app from the console logs page, the logs do show up\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb9d0d56-b093-4430-b221-1000b85a33f7)\n\nBut they do not if you restart from the resource list on the homepage\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bb053ff-6e48-4e66-8899-8c40e885fae2)\n\n\nThis scenario also produces an odd error in the AppHost console\n\n```\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.ContainerReconciler[0]\n      could not create the container    {\"Container\": {\"name\":\"nonexist0-dnueesrv\"}, \"Reconciliation\": 9, \"ContainerName\": \"nonexist0-dnueesrv\", \"error\": \"object not found\\ncontainer not found\\ndocker command \u0027CreateContainer\u0027 returned with non-zero exit code 1: command output: Stdout: \u0027\u0027 Stderr: \u0027\u0027\"}\n```\n\n\"could not create the container\" failing because of \"container not found\" is a bit circular. The container creation should have standard output or error, so I\u0027d expect hte `Stdout` or `Stderr` fields in the error to contain something (` Unable to find image...`).  Seems to me like DCP isn\u0027t fully detecting the initial container creation error, and is then falling back to some form of timeout.\n\n",

If I take the following example:\n\n```\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar redis = builder.AddContainer(\"redis\", \"redis\")\n                   .WithEndpoint(name: \"tcp\", targetPort: 6379);\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cWorker\u003e(\"worker\")\n       .WithEnvironment(context =\u003e\n       {\n           var endpoint = redis.GetEndpoint(\"tcp\");\n\n           // Use .Property to access Host and Port expressions and defer evaluation\n           var redisHost = endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Host);\n           var redisPort = endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port);\n\n           // Set these values as REDIS_HOST/PORT on the target resource\n           context.EnvironmentVariables[\"REDIS_HOST\"] = redisHost;\n           context.EnvironmentVariables[\"REDIS_PORT\"] = redisPort;\n       });\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nthen the \"REDIS_HOST\" is resolved to value \"localhost\". I would have expected this to resolve to the hostname of the target container (\"redis\" in this case). The application which requires the alternative connectionstring settings is running from a container, so \u0027localhost\" would not point to the correct container. Could this be a bug?\n\n\nI created a custom resource which spins up a container:\n\n```\n    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cServiceResource\u003e AddXXX(this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,\n        [ResourceName] string name)\n    {\n        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(builder);\n        ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(name);\n\n        var resource = new ServiceResource(name);\n\n        return builder.AddResource(resource)\n            .WithImage(ContainerImageTags.Image, ContainerImageTags.Tag)\n            .WithImageRegistry(ContainerImageTags.Registry);\n    }\n```\nAnd I set it up like this:\n\n```\nvar myService= builder.AddXXX(\"service-name\")\n    .WithEnvironment(context =\u003e\n    {\n        var endpoint = rabbitMQ.GetEndpoint(\"tcp\");\n\n        // Use .Property to access Host and Port expressions and defer evaluation\n        var host = endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Host);\n        var port = endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.Port);\n\n        context.EnvironmentVariables[\"XXX__Host\"] = host;\n        context.EnvironmentVariables[\"XXX__Port\"] = port;\n        context.EnvironmentVariables[\"XXX__UserName\"] = \"\";\n        context.EnvironmentVariables[\"XXX__Password\"] = \"\";\n    })\n    .WaitFor(rabbitMQ);\n```\n\nBoth RabbitMQ and my service (which should connect to RabbitMQ) run from a container, but it does not seem to resolve (container to container) properly.\n\nAlso, the RabbitMQ integration also contains a username and password in the connectionstring, which is not part of the properties (endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.**XXX**)).

This is because the signature for the method requires an `IResourceBuilder\u003cTSource\u003e` and things like `EndpointReference` aren\u0027t resources.\n\nI tried changing the `WithReferences` overloads to accept straight `TSourceN` typed parameters rather than `IResourceBuilder\u003cTSourceN\u003e` and that works, but now you need to dot into the `Resource` property when adding references to other resources, e.g.:\n\n```csharp\nvar frontend = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.MyFrontend\u003e(\"frontend\")\n                      .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n                      .WithReferences(basketService.Resource, catalogService.GetEndpoint(\"f\"))\n```\n\nI tried to make `IResourceBuilder\u003cTResource\u003e` support implicitly converting to `TResource` (by simply returning `this.Resource`) to resolve this but you can\u0027t implement implicit operators on interfaces.\n\nIt would be **possible** to have the enough overloads for all possible combinations of sources where a source is either an `IResourceBuilder\u003cTSourceN\u003e` or a non-resource `TSourceN` but that is super unwieldy (e.g. if we wanted to support up to 9 sources I think we\u0027d need 2^9 overloads).\n\nEven if we did want to have all those overloads, supporting overloads that support sources that have more requirements than just `IResourceWithEnvironment` for the destination is further impractical as it pushes those source types to add a generic type arg in order to define the multiple requirements as type constraints, e.g. `OrleansService` would have to become `OrleansService\u003cTDestination\u003e where TDestination : IResourceWithEnvironment, IResourceWithEndpoints`, which of course has viral effects.\n\nNote, supporting an overload of `WaitFor` that accepts multiple other resources doesn\u0027t have any of these issues and could be done easily.\n\nSo, ultimately there\u0027s a few tensions working against each other here WRT supporting `WithReferences`. If we were to limit the `WithReferences` method to accepting `IResourceBuilder\u003cTSource\u003e` it\u0027s fairly clean, but then you can\u0027t pass things like `EndpointReference` to it. If you want it support things `EndpointReference` as sources, then you need to accept having to resolve the `Resource` property for resources you want to pass to it or have a very large number of overloads. And then it still doesn\u0027t support more complex sources like `OrleansService`.\n\nHaving `WithReferences` only support a subset of the possible sources that can otherwise be passed to an overload of `WithReference(TSource source)` seems like it would cause some confusion, e.g. \"why can I pass this thing to `WithReferences` but not this other thing that I **can** pass to `WithReference`?\".",

                                           "body":  "Another idea is to introduce a new method `WithDependency` that combines referencing and waiting for another resource in a single call:\n\n```csharp\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cTDestination\u003e WithDependency\u003cTSource, TDestination\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cTDestination\u003e builder, IResourceBuilder\u003cTSource\u003e, WaitBehavior? waitBehavior = null)\n    where TSource : IReferenceable\u003cTSource, TDestination\u003e, IResourceWithWaitSupport\n{\n    TSource.ProcessReference(source, builder);\n    return builder.WaitFor(source, waitBehavior);\n}\n```\n\nThis would still require the work to introduce `IReferenceable\u003cTSource, TDestination\u003e` and ensuring any resources with custom reference logic get updated to implement this interface, e.g. `QdrantServerResource`, and would be limited to use with only other resources as only other resources can be waited for. And of course it introduces a new concept of \"dependency\" which combines two existing concepts of \"reference\" and \"wait for\". There would still be cases where one needs to know to call `WithReference` instead of `WithDependency` to wire up service discovery, e.g. for `EndpointReference` and `OrleansService`.\n\nThis could be relaxed though by having another overload that doesn\u0027t enforce the `IResourceWithWaitSupport` in the generic type constraint but rather makes it a runtime check and only performing the `WaitFor` call if the passed `TSource` implements `IResourceWithWaitSupport`. The overload with the `waitBehavior` argument would still have the generic type constraing, e.g.:\n\n```csharp\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cTDestination\u003e WithDependency\u003cTSource, TDestination\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cTDestination\u003e builder, IResourceBuilder\u003cTSource\u003e)\n    where TSource : IReferenceable\u003cTSource, TDestination\u003e\n{\n    TSource.ProcessReference(source, builder);\n    return TSource is IResourceWithWaitSupport waitable ? builder.WaitFor(waitable) : builder;\n}\n\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cTDestination\u003e WithDependency\u003cTSource, TDestination\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cTDestination\u003e builder, IResourceBuilder\u003cTSource\u003e, WaitBehavior waitBehavior)\n    where TSource : IReferenceable\u003cTSource, TDestination\u003e, IResourceWithWaitSupport\n{\n    TSource.ProcessReference(source, builder);\n    return builder.WaitFor(source, waitBehavior);\n}\n```",

        "body":  "In 9.2 we added resource icons to the resources table and graph views. We should go further and enable resources to specify their own custom icons to be used when displayed in the dashboard. This should be done in such a way that hosting integrations can specify custom icons for their resources, so that, e.g., the Redis resource could show up with the Redis icon in the dashboard.\n\nThe icon itself would need to be sent from the app host resource server to the dashboard process so would need to be serializable. I imagine we\u0027d want to support SVG which has the advantage of being vector and text-based. We could support bitmap-based formats like PNG, ICO, JPG, etc., by encoding them as data-uris.\n\nI imagine an API kinda like the following for using a file on disk:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"foo\", \"foo\")\n    .WithResourceIcon(\"./myicon.svg\");\n```\n\nAnd perhaps something like this for something embedded, e.g. in a hosting integration:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"foo\", \"foo\")\n    .WithResourceIcon(EncodeAsDataUri(Resources.MyIcon), ImageFormat.Png);\n```",

Please describe the problem.\n\nBased on discussion https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/discussions/2069\n\nI would like to configure CPU and memory usage in code (e.g., in `Program.cs`) for Aspire projects, without relying solely on Azure-specific or YAML-based configuration. Currently, there appears to be no built-in way to do this within Aspire itself.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIntroduce an API or extension methods in Aspire that let developers specify CPU and memory limits directly in code. This approach would allow local or code-based configuration that mimics production-like settings.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI initially thought this might be possible using [Azure.Provisioning](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Azure.Provisioning_1.0.0/sdk/provisioning/Azure.Provisioning/README.md), but after looking more closely, it seems Aspire does not expose CPU/memory configuration in code. Adding such functionality would greatly improve our development workflow.",

launchSettings.json, is there? It seems a waste of resources, and AppHost should just start if the profile selected is fine, ignoring other profiles.\n\nOutside the scope of this issue: the env var parser could be improved, just taking the number as a string, like bash vars and .env files work.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAdd a profile with an env var where the value is a number.\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET 9\nAspire 9.1",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nSince Aspire 9.2 when running locally I\u0027ve been hitting issues where it starts complaining of duplicate keys in secrets.json (for the AppHost).\n\ne.g.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8cdd7b4-2183-4fd6-940a-b1d6fbdd29f4)\n\nWhen I go to look at the file, both the formatting has been changed and duplicate keys created.\n\nSo if the json was previously:\n\nFormat 1:\n```json\n\"Azure\" : {\n     \"Tenant\": \"somevalue\"\n     etc...\n}\n```\n\nThis ends up as \n\nFormat 2:\n```json\n\"Azure:Tenant\": \"somevalue\"\n```\n\nSometimes it generates a mixture of the two formats with the duplicate keys.\n\nIf I delete the contents of the file leaving just the connection string to an external SQL resource and press f5, it will regenerate the file again, reformatting my existing settings as \u0027Format 2\u0027 above, and generates new settings with \u0027Format 1\u0027. But if you stop debugging and start again, it all gets regenerated as \u0027Format 2\u0027. It\u0027s when you go to add new resources again after that, that it seems to get a mixture of formats and duplicate keys.\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsecrets.json format should be consistent, and probably stay as \u0027Format 1\u0027 from the description above.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nCreate an aspire project. Configure your Azure subscription id, resource group and location in appsettings.json of AppHost.\n\nConnect to an existing sql resource with a connection string e.g. builder.AddConnectionString, and put this connection string in secrets.json.\n\nConnect other Azure resources like storage, configuring them in apphost, e.g. builder.AddAzureStorage.\n\nRun the project with F5 and see if secrets.json gets mangled or duplications with each step above.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nDuplicate key exception for secrets.json\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:

 \n* Should runtime guards throw (or assert) when a publish-only member is accessed under a run-mode tag?  \n* Can a Roslyn analyzer warn when publish-only members are used in run-time code paths?  \n* At minimum we need docs that state: after a view switch certain members are undefined and accessing them is user error.\n\nThese remain open and must be tracked as follow-up work once the union mechanics are in place.\n\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/7251 for an initial prototype",

                                           "body":  "I\u0027ve been playing around with this concept a bit - specifically around converting Containers to Projects.  It works at a high level, but I\u0027ve hit a few oddities.\n\n## Oddities if leaving if a resource is treated as both container and executable\n\nIn my first iteration of `AsProject`, I copied all annotations over to the new project resource (including the `ContainerImageAnnotation`).  This led to a number of weird situations:\n\n- It seems like aspire starts both the exe and the container, but it only shows logs for the container.\n- If the exe exits after the container starts up, the resource state transitions to `Exited` but the container is still running / putting out logs.  (It is very confusing when you\u0027re seeing logs continuing to show up in an `Exited` resource.\n- You end up with two stop / restart buttons ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebfe9e0a-e7be-4ebd-a7ea-208516d487ad)\n\nI think Phase A as suggested above should sort this problem out.\n\n## Endpoint Target Port\n\nWith containers, you must specify a target port.  But for executables you almost never want to specify the target port.  This means there\u0027s no good way to configure your endpoints to work as both a project and a container without needing to do targeted modifications when converting the resource.\n\n## Contextual endpoint resolution\n\nI think this will also make #7153 even more important - right now you can work around the lack of that by knowing the exact context your resource is going o be run in.  But if that context can be changed by further callers, those assumptions will no longer work out.  I\u0027ve already encountered one situation where I have to add a `WithEnvironment` callback and conditionally specify the server address / port differently depending on whether the resource resolves as a container or a project. \n\n```cs\n              .WithEnvironment(x =\u003e\n              {\n                  if (x.Resource is ContainerResource)\n                  {\n                      x.EnvironmentVariables[\"LocalRabbitMqServerAddress\"] = rabbitMq.Resource.Name;\n                      x.EnvironmentVariables[\"LocalRabbitMqServerPort\"] = rabbitMq.Resource.PrimaryEndpoint.TargetPort;\n                  }\n                  else\n                  {\n                      x.EnvironmentVariables[\"LocalRabbitMqServerAddress\"] = rabbitMq.Resource.PrimaryEndpoint.Host;\n                      x.EnvironmentVariables[\"LocalRabbitMqServerPort\"] = rabbitMq.Resource.PrimaryEndpoint.Port;\n                  }\n              })\n```\n\n\nFor reference, what I\u0027ve been playing around with:\n\n```cs\ninternal static class ProjectSubstitution\n{\n    // Multiple generic params on an extension method is a bit nasty - whilst a single generic parm\n    // is often resolved implicitly, that isn\u0027t true with multiple args\n    // But it does mean the converted resource has an explicit conversion to the old resource type\n    // Alowing you to continue using it with methods taking the container based type\n    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cProjectResource\u003cT\u003e\u003e AsProject\u003cT, V\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder)\n        where T : ContainerResource\n        where V : IProjectMetadata, new()\n    {\n        // Remove the original resoruce\n        var originalResource = builder.Resource;\n        builder.ApplicationBuilder.Resources.Remove(originalResource);\n\n        // WithProjectDefaults is internal, so create a temporary project resource\n        // and steal the resulting annotations.\n        var tempProject = builder.ApplicationBuilder.AddProject\u003cV\u003e(builder.Resource.Name, options =\u003e options.ExcludeKestrelEndpoints = true);\n        builder.ApplicationBuilder.Resources.Remove(tempProject.Resource);\n        builder.ApplicationBuilder.Resources.Remove(originalResource);\n\n\n        // Now create the substitue resource, using the original resoruce\u0027s annotations\n        // As well as the extra project annotations\n        var resource = new ProjectResource\u003cT\u003e(originalResource);\n        foreach (var annotation in tempProject.Resource.Annotations)\n        {\n            resource.Annotations.Add(annotation);\n        }\n\n        // Strip out container related annotations\n        // Otherwise weird things happenw ith aspire tyring to run both the container and the executable\n        var containerAnnotations = originalResource.Annotations.OfType\u003cContainerImageAnnotation\u003e().ToArray();\n        foreach (var annotation in containerAnnotations)\n        {\n            resource.Annotations.Remove(annotation);\n        }\n\n        // For containers, you have to specify a target port, but for executable resources you\n        // may want to rely on DCP to allocate a dynamic port for you\n        foreach (var endpoint in originalResource.Annotations.OfType\u003cEndpointAnnotation\u003e())\n        {\n            if (endpoint.Port == null \u0026\u0026  endpoint.IsProxied)\n            {\n                endpoint.TargetPort = null;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return builder.ApplicationBuilder.AddResource(resource);\n    }\n}\n\n\npublic class ProjectResource\u003cT\u003e : ProjectResource\n   where T : ContainerResource\n{\n    private readonly T _inner;\n\n    public ProjectResource(T inner) : base(inner.Name)\n    {\n        _inner = inner;\n        // Remove all container annotations to ensure aspire doens\u0027t try to start the resource as both a project and a container\n        var containerAnnotations = inner.Annotations.OfType\u003cContainerImageAnnotation\u003e().ToArray();\n        foreach (var annotation in inner.Annotations)\n        {\n            inner.Annotations.Remove(annotation);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public override ResourceAnnotationCollection Annotations =\u003e _inner.Annotations;\n\n    public static explicit operator T(ProjectResource\u003cT\u003e resource) =\u003e resource._inner;\n}\n```",

        "body":  "# Overview\nWe’ve identified the need for certain events in the Aspire application model to be “replayable.” This will allow late subscribers to receive previously published events, improving reliability and developer ergonomics—especially for scenarios where events are used to collect information from disparate parts of the codebase.\n\n# Proposed Design\n\n1. Opt-In via Marker Interface\nEvents that wish to be replayable will implement an IReplayableEvent marker interface.\n2. Event Scoping\nAspire supports two flavors of distributed application events:\nGlobal events: Not associated with any resource.\nResource-scoped events: Tied to a specific resource.\nReplay buffers must be maintained for both global and resource-scoped events. When a subscriber joins, they will receive the appropriate buffered events for the subscription’s scope (global or per-resource).\n3. Event Buffering and Replay\nWhen a replayable event is published, it is added to an internal, thread-safe buffer.\nGlobal events: buffer keyed by event type.\nResource-scoped events: buffer keyed by event type and resource identifier.\nWhen a new subscriber is added:\nFor global events: all buffered global events of the subscribed type are replayed to the subscriber.\nFor resource-scoped events: all buffered events for the specified resource/event type are replayed.\nBuffers must be thread-safe (e.g., using ConcurrentQueue\u003cT\u003e or immutable collections).\nWhen replaying, a snapshot (copy) of the events in the buffer should be taken and iterated over for the new subscription.\n4. Dispatch Behavior Constraint\nImportant: Replayable events (IReplayableEvent) may only be published using EventDispatchBehavior.NonBlocking.\nAttempting to publish a replayable event with a blocking dispatch behavior (e.g., Blocking, BlockingCollectResults) must throw an exception or otherwise fail-fast.\nThis prevents subtle bugs, as replay semantics are inherently asynchronous and not compatible with blocking dispatch.\n5. Thread Safety\nAll buffers and subscription logic must be thread-safe to allow concurrent publishing and subscription from different parts of the application.6. \n6. Other ConsiderationsRetention policy: Consider whether to retain all replayable events forever, only a fixed number per type/resource, or until explicitly cleared.\n\nDocumentation: The marker interface and dispatch behavior constraint should be clearly documented.\nExtensibility: Start with immediate replay on subscription; if needed, more advanced signaling (subscriber readiness) can be considered later.\n\nExample Usage\n```C#\npublic class FooEvent : IReplayableEvent { ... }\n\n// Publishing a global replayable event\neventing.Publish(new FooEvent(), EventDispatchBehavior.NonBlocking);\n\n// Subscribing globally (receives previously published FooEvents)\neventing.Subscribe\u003cFooEvent\u003e(e =\u003e { ... });\n\n// Subscribing for a specific resource (receives previously published events for that resource)\neventing.Subscribe\u003cFooEvent\u003e(\"resourceId\", e =\u003e { ... });\n```\n\nThis feature will allow developers to reliably receive important events even if their subscriptions are registered after those events are initially published, without introducing blocking or timing issues.",

That said, I am not sure if the `ExpressionResolver` code referenced above is the real culprit.\n\nWhen you see a template function invocation `{{- portForServing \"exe\" -}}` instead of the expected value, it mean this template function invocation failed. This is usually because the argument of the function refers to a DCP \"Service\u0027 (roughly equivalent to Aspire \"Endpoint\") that does not exist. \n\nFrom the example above I would focus on `endpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.TargetPort))` part. The reference to `TargetPort` is translated to `portForServing` invocation, which is correct. What is surprising is the attempt to reference the Executable itself via the parameter. I would expect the Endpoint to be referenced instead (i.e. the parameter for `portForServing` to be `http`, or something related to the \"http\" Endpoint).",

Please describe the problem.\n\nI am trying to pull container images, but I have to do this in the CLI.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI would like an option in the web UI to do this.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI *could* change the pull policy, but this presents a problem for some private repos. For example, ACR tokens time out in less than a day (no idea if this can be changed - doesn\u0027t matter: most users will experience this by default) meaning that an \"always\" pull policy will spuriously fail (even if the container has no changes) multiple times a day and require the developer to use `az acr login` from the CLI anyway.\n\nThe better option would be to allow the developer to initiate the pull from the UI.\n\nI would PR this myself, but DCP is undocumented and closed source.\n\nRestarting the container issue is another discussion entirely and probably shouldn\u0027t bog this one down. It isn\u0027t too much to ask to click \"pull\" and then \"restart\".",

The app host currently makes the assumption that all endpoint ports are fully allocated (and `EndpointsAllocatedEvent` fires) before any resources are created, but we may not know the allocated target port for an un-proxied container until DCP has created the resource as we likely need to support the scenario where the container runtime allocates a random port.\n\nThis is the biggest pain point with making un-proxied containers the default and we should consider that `EndpointsAllocatedEvent` and `ResourceEndpointsAllocatedEvent` may not be able to fire until after DCP has started creating resources in some scenarios. Fortunately, in most cases where we\u0027re using `EndpointsAllocatedEvent`, there\u0027s a more appropriate event that we could use instead such as `BeforeResourceStartedEvent`, particularly when dealing with container-to-container resource endpoints as there\u0027s no need to wait for endpoint allocation as the internal port is used, not the host port.",

        "body":  "We are considering introducing a feature to the CLI where from the command-prompt you can interrogate a running app host to get values to support running other commands on the command-line.\n\nWe might have something like this:\n\n```bash\naspire get-cs mydb\nstdout: \u003cconnectionstring\u003e\n```\n\nThe way this would work is that when the apphost is launched we would determine the unix path that the apphost is listening on for a connection deterministically based on the apphost path.\n\nThe `aspire get-cs` command would find the apphost the same way that `aspire run` does (based on working directory context and `.aspire/settings.json`.\n\nOnce the apphost and live unix socket path is detected the apphost could be connected to and interrogated. We\u0027d probably have to have mechanisms in the design to wait until the apphost was healthy.\n\nWe may wish to introduce an annotation with a callback into the app model which represents a value that can be queried for each resource. So you might end up with something like:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddResource(...)\n       .WithGetCallback(\"connectionString\", (...) =\u003e {});\n```\n\nThat way developers designing resources could specifically expose additional values if they chose to (e.g. output values from azure provisioner deployments).",

Please describe the problem.\n\n### Scenario\n1. Run Aspire application from Visual Studio or VS Code.\n2. Switch to VS, right-click on one of the projects that belong to the running application, choose \"Rebuild\"\n3. Observe Aspire dashboard\n\n### Expected\nThe dashboard should indicate that the project is not running when it is being rebuild\n- Resource state should be different from \"Running\"\n- Process ID should disappear (the old process ID is no longer valid)\n- The project should be considered \"unhealthy\"\n\n### Actual\nWhen the project is being rebuilt, there is no change to the project state in Aspire dashboard. This includes the case if the rebuild fails, which may take developer a long time to remedy.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI propose we introduce a new state for projects/Executables: Suspended\n\n1. When rebuild starts, the Executable goes into Suspended state. There is new notification type for this that the IDE sends to DCP, which in turn notifies the Aspire dashboard.\n2. The IDE needs to send a Suspended notification for all active debug sessions that are affected by project rebuild.\n3. In Suspended state \n    a. The project/Executable is not running. Process ID is no longer available.\n    b. The project is considered unhealthy.\n    b. Dashboard can still request logs, but stop/restart gestures should be disabled.\n4. From Suspended state the Executable can only transition to Exited state, or Running state (upon receiving Session Terminated, or Process Restarted notifications, respectively).\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe work required here spans DCP, IDE execution protocol, VS/VS Code/other IDEs that might support this scenario, Aspire dashboard and Aspire resource health.\n\n@LittleLittleCloud @danegsta @JakeRadMSFT @JamesNK @adamint @rafaelldi FYI",

Please describe the problem.\n\nCurrently `.WithVolume()` only really works if your container runs as a root user.  If your container runs as anythign other than root, you won\u0027t be able to write to the volume\n\n```cs\nvar container = builder.AddContainer(\"sdk\", \"mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0\")\n    //https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/containers/8.0/app-user\n    .WithEntrypoint(\"sh\")\n    .WithArgs(\"-c\", \"\"\"\n        echo \"Creating file in /home/app/mount\"\n        mkdir -p /home/app/mount/dir\n        echo \"hello\" \u003e\u003e /home/app/mount/file\n\n        echo \"Creating file in /mnt/something\"\n        mkdir -p /mnt/something/dir\n        echo \"hello\" \u003e\u003e /mnt/something/file\n\n        echo \"Creating file in /tmp/something\"\n        mkdir -p /tmp/something/dir\n        echo \"hello\" \u003e\u003e /tmp/something/file\n        \n        echo \"Done\"\n        sleep 5000000\n    \"\"\".ReplaceLineEndings(\"\\n\"));\n\n// Run as non root (user == app)\ncontainer.WithContainerRuntimeArgs(\"--user\", \"1654:1654\");\n\n// Create volumes\ncontainer\n    .WithVolume(\"/mnt/something\")\n    .WithVolume(\"/tmp/something\")\n    .WithVolume(\"/home/app/mount\")\n    ;\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIdeally I\u0027d like to see `WithVolume(\"/path\")`, just work for non root users, being writeable by the container user (assuming readonly wasn\u0027t set to true).  If not, some kind of overload to `WithVolume` so I can specify what permissions the volume should be created would be nice.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have also experimented with the ContainerFiles api to see if that helps.  This grants all the appropriate permissions if I don\u0027t use a volume mount, but volume mounts seem to ignore these permissions.\n```cs\nvar mode = UnixFileMode.UserRead | UnixFileMode.GroupRead | UnixFileMode.OtherRead\n                    | UnixFileMode.UserWrite | UnixFileMode.GroupWrite | UnixFileMode.OtherWrite;\n\ncontainer.WithContainerFiles(\"/\", [\n        new ContainerDirectory{\n            Name = \"mnt\",\n            Entries = [\n                new ContainerDirectory{\n                    Name = \"something\",\n                    Owner = 1654,\n                    Group = 1654,\n                    Mode = mode,\n                    Entries = [\n                        new ContainerDirectory{\n                            Name = \"mount\",\n                            Owner = 1654,\n                            Group = 1654,\n                            Mode = mode }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n        ])\n    ;\n```",

So you could view this as eliminating one of two pain points, rather than moving a pain point from local dev to production.\n\nI wonder if we need some higher level filesystem type abstractions?\n\nWe now have a few different ways of getting files into containers (bind mounts, volumes, ).  Each of which has their own quirks, and the quirks also vary based on the environment you deploy to (docker vs compose vs k8s).  I suspect he majority of people don\u0027t really care how we get the files into a container, just that they\u0027re there.  The generic api could also help mitigate some of the magic concerns as you\u0027d expect a bit more magic from a higher level api, and those who dont\u0027 want that magic can fall back to the specific implementations.\n\nThis abstraction could also apply to non container resources (e.g. using `IAspireStore` for executable / project resources).  And in turn this abstraction would help with #8984, allowing you to specify files / directories in a way that applies to both container, project and executables (and more).\n\nMy initial thought for this was something like `.WithFile()`, `.WithDirectory()`, where inputs include File/Directory name,\u0027 permissions, initial contents\n\nBut then I feel like you\u0027ll want to reference these files programmatically (particularly with #8984 in mind where you don\u0027t know the TargetPath and will need a `ReferenceExpression` type thing, so maybe they need to be dedicated sub-resources.\n\n```cs\nvar sqlLite = app.AddFile()\napp.WithEnvironment(\"SQLITE_DB, sqlLite)\n```\n\n(Don\u0027t think these are final API shapes, just a few minutes of throwing initial ideas out from me)\n",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHello everyone,\nA service is inaccessible when we configure the Kestrel url in appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json of the project (service A). \nIn certain situations, it\u0027s necessary to have two configuration files, appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json. In this way, one will be used for production, and the other only for development. \nWhen Aspire.AppHost Dashboard starts up, it reads the configuration settings in the appsettings.json file for each project (in this case, service A), regardless of whether you explicitly state in your project code (service A) that you want to use appsettings.Development.json. Both files will be read, but differently. Aspire.AppHost will launch service A with the appsettings.json file. And service A itself will load the appsettings.Development.json during its construction.  And this creates a conflict in the kestrel configuration in both files. If Kestrel URL is defini, in both configuration files, we\u0027ll get an error. But this error isn\u0027t displayed in the log, nor in the dashboard. You\u0027ll just be unable to connect to service A\u0027s website. \nTo work around this, you need to comment out/delete the URL configuration line in kestrel in the appsettings.Development.json file. Because if you comment out/delete it in the appsettings.json file. The bug will persist!\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAs described in the previous section, the expected behavior is to have Aspire load a service based on the configuration file specified in the service. This file can be appsettings.json, or appsettings.Development.json. Its selection will depend on the project and not on Aspire\u0027s default choice.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n[A project reproducing the bug. ](https://github.com/Layiri/AspireAppBugTracker.git)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n`\nPS C:\\Users\\users\u003e dotnet --info\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.300\n Commit:            15606fe0a8\n Workload version:  9.0.300-manifests.af4147de\n MSBuild version:   17.14.5+edd3bbf37\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.300\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36109.1\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.51/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\9.0.51\\WorkloadManifest.json\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n [aspire]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36109.1\n   Manifest Version:    8.2.2/8.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\8.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.aspire\\8.2.2\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.409 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n",

Please describe the problem.\n\nPersistent containers are great for speeding up dependencies in consecutive runs of an AppHost.   However if you finish using an application and move to work on a different application, they\u0027ll continue to hang around until you shut down docker completely.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIt would be nice to have a way to tell aspire to shut down all containers (**including** persistent ones).  A few ideas for how this could be done\n\n- A toggle in the aspire UI which when enabled will cause aspire to stop all containers on shut down.\n- An \"Exit\" button in the dashboard UI, which can also include an option to shut down all resources.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Currently, when running `dotnet run AppHost.cs` or `dotnet AppHost.cs`, the project is compiled with AOT, which leads to errors in AppHost. Therefore, you must explicitly set `#:property PublishAot=false`. This could be implied by the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` to avoid confusion for developers who may not be aware of this requirement.\n2. The following configuration logic could ideally be provided as defaults by the `DistributedApplicationBuilder` itself. This would streamline local development and reduce boilerplate, allowing developers to focus on application-specific settings rather than repeatedly specifying common environment and logging options:\n   ```csharp\n    // Required settings\n    builder.Configuration[\"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\"] ??= \"Development\";\n    builder.Configuration[\"ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL\"] ??= \"http://localhost:4317\";\n    builder.Configuration[\"ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL\"] ??= \"http://localhost:5001\";\n\n    // Optional settings to improve local development experience\n    builder.Configuration[\"ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT\"] ??= \"true\";\n    builder.Configuration[\"ASPNETCORE_URLS\"] ??= \"http://localhost:5003\";\n\n    builder.Configuration[\"Logging:LogLevel:Default\"] ??= \"Information\";\n    builder.Configuration[\"Logging:LogLevel:Aspire.Hosting.Dcp\"] ??= \"Warning\";\n    builder.Configuration[\"Logging:LogLevel:Microsoft.AspNetCore\"] ??= \"Warning\";\n   ```\n3. When using `#:sdk Aspire.AppHost.Sdk@9.3.1`, you must also explicitly specify `#:sdk Microsoft.NET.Sdk` because `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` does not implicitly include the .NET SDK. This can be confusing, as one might expect the AppHost SDK to bring all required dependencies automatically. In general, it would be beneficial if the AppHost SDK could automatically include the necessary .NET SDK and other common dependencies like `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost` to reduce the need for manual configuration in the project file.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the introduction of a dedicated Aspire SDK alias such as `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Aspire`, similar to established SDKs like `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` or `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker`, the setup process could be greatly simplified. This would enable developers to focus on building application features rather than managing environment configuration, resulting in a more streamlined and developer-friendly experience.\n\nOne open question remains: Would the release cycle of Aspire, with such an integration, then be directly tied to the .NET version, similar to the other SDKs?\n\nA more streamlined configuration could look like this:\n\n```csharp\n#!/usr/bin/env dotnet\n\n#:sdk Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Aspire // Could this be versioned like `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Aspire@9.3.1`?\n\n#:package Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL@9.*\n#:project Api/Api.csproj\n\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar postgres = builder.AddPostgres(\"postgres\")\n                      .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);\n\nvar postgresdb = postgres.AddDatabase(\"db\");\n\nvar migration = builder.AddCSharpScript(\"api-db-migration\", \"Api.Db.Migration.cs\")\n                       .WithParentRelationship(postgres)\n                       .WithReference(postgresdb)\n                       .WaitFor(postgresdb);\n\nvar api = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Api\u003e(\"api\")\n                 .WithReference(postgresdb)\n                 .WaitFor(postgresdb);\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```",

That default would be unsecured which is something we won\u0027t do (by default). We\u0027re looking to introduce support for \"implicit launch profiles\" so that the SDK can provide a default launch profile in the case the app doesn\u0027t have one and all these settings would be taken care of there.\n3. We chose to keep the Aspire SDK separate and make the project compose it as necessary but it\u0027s possible we could update it to auto-import the NET SDK if it detects it hasn\u0027t been already.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf a resource that has a proxy that DCP can\u0027t start because port is in use, DCP will incorrectly report that the resource is running. For example:\n\n```cs\nvar s1Echo = builder\n    .AddContainer(\"s1-echo\", \"hashicorp/http-echo\")\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(8080, targetPort: 5678);\n\ns1Echo\n    .WithEnvironment(\"ECHO_TEXT\", $\"Hello from {s1Echo.GetEndpoint(\"http\")}\");\n```\nIf port 8080 is in use then DCP will report the resource is running and green in the dashboard. In the background it will retry for a long time to start the proxy on 8080. Trying to access the resource using 8080 will fail. This is confusing to the user because the resource reports it is running successfully.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5be0f16-5fd3-4a71-9243-949dc81bc714)\n\nDCP eventually it writes an error message to the app host console:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de35d78-6541-417b-af03-0ceddf064d4d)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe resource should be in a `Starting` state until the proxy at 8080 is running. If DCP can\u0027t run the proxy then the resource should go into a `FailedToStart` state. Right now there is a very long timeout when trying to start the proxy. I think 30 seconds is probably the max we should make users wait before giving them feedback.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "\u003eDisclaimer: AI was used to compose a good coherent proposal with sources from code examples and the general idea description for the API.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\nThis is intended to solve a simple problem: `launchSettings.json` are often \"optimized\" for working with a single app/microservice in isolation, and so having the ability to override or set the settings for each project in a type-safe manner would allow a much better developer experience.\n\nLaunch profiles drive Aspire’s local orchestration: they decide URLs, env-vars, debug flags, and whether `dotnet watch` is used ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/launch-profiles)][1]).\nToday the only API surface is `launchProfileName` on `AddProject`, which merely picks a profile and copies a handful of fields ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.projectresourcebuilderextensions.addproject?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0)][2]). Features such as hot-reload, alternate executables, or ad-hoc env-vars still require hand-editing JSON, breaking Aspire’s “configure everything in code” ethos ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/app-host-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)][3], [[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/networking-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)][4]).\n\nA fluent `WithLaunchSettings` delegate mirrors existing builder hooks like `WithEndpoint`, `WithEnvironment`, `WithArgs`, and `WithReplicas` ([[apisof.net](https://apisof.net/catalog/8727891aef3d4a57985d393ded635fe5?fx=net46)][5], [[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withenvironment?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0)][6], [[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withargs?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0)][7], [[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.projectresourcebuilderextensions.withreplicas?view=dotnet-aspire-9.2\u0026utm_source=chatgpt.com)][8], [[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withendpoint?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0\u0026utm_source=chatgpt.com)][9]) while letting developers compose or mutate launch properties programmatically.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nfile-scoped namespace Aspire.Hosting;\n\npublic static class ResourceBuilderLaunchSettingsExtensions\n{\n+   /// \u003csummary\u003eMutate or create the effective launch profile for a project resource.\u003c/summary\u003e\n+   public static IResourceBuilder\u003cProjectResource\u003e WithLaunchSettings(\n+       this IResourceBuilder\u003cProjectResource\u003e builder,\n+       Action\u003cLaunchProfileBuilder\u003e configure);\n}\n\npublic sealed class LaunchProfileBuilder\n{\n    // Fluent modifiers – return \u0027this\u0027 for chaining\n    public LaunchProfileBuilder Profile(string name);\n    public LaunchProfileBuilder ApplicationUrl(string url);\n    public LaunchProfileBuilder CommandLineArgs(string args);\n    public LaunchProfileBuilder ExecutablePath(string path);\n    public LaunchProfileBuilder WorkingDirectory(string path);\n    public LaunchProfileBuilder Environment(string key, string value);\n    public LaunchProfileBuilder DotNetArguments(string args);\n    // Additional members map 1-to-1 with launchSettings.json when needed\n}\n```\n\n* Restriction to **`ProjectResource`** ensures compile-time safety; launch settings are a .NET-specific construct ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.applicationmodel.projectresource?view=dotnet-aspire-8.0)][10]).\n* Implementation simply appends a `LaunchProfileAnnotation` to the in-memory model, similar to how `WithEndpoint` or `WithEnvironment` append their annotations ([[apisof.net](https://apisof.net/catalog/8727891aef3d4a57985d393ded635fe5?fx=net46)][5], [[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withenvironment?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0)][6]).\n\n---\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\nvar api = builder\n    .AddProject\u003cProjects.WebApi\u003e(\"api\")\n    .WithLaunchSettings(ls =\u003e ls\n        .Profile(\"https\")\n        .ExecutablePath(\"dotnet\")\n        .CommandLineArgs(\"watch run\")\n        .ApplicationUrl(\"https://localhost:5050\")\n        .Environment(\"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\", \"Development\"));\n\nvar frontend = builder\n    .AddProject\u003cProjects.Frontend\u003e(\"frontend\")\n    .WithLaunchSettings(ls =\u003e ls\n        .Profile(\"dev\")\n        .CommandLineArgs(\"npm run dev\")\n        .WorkingDirectory(\"../frontend\")\n        .Environment(\"PORT\", \"0\"))     // Aspire patches actual port\n    .WaitFor(api)\n    .WithReference(api);\n```\n\nThe pattern looks and feels identical to other Aspire builder helpers, so existing muscle memory applies ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withargs?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0)][7], [[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withendpoint?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0\u0026utm_source=chatgpt.com)][9]).\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n| Option                                                  | Why Rejected                                                                                           |\n| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Parameter-only** `WithLaunchSettings(string profile)` | Duplicates `launchProfileName`; still forces JSON edits for everything else.                           |\n| **Raw-JSON overload**                                   | Loses IntelliSense and static validation; violates SRP.                                                |\n| **MSBuild property injection**                          | Requires rebuilds for every tweak, slowing the inner loop Aspire optimises ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/launch-profiles)][1]). |\n\n---\n\n\n## Implementation sketch\n\nThe extension should mimic the existing *annotation* pattern used by Aspire’s other fluent helpers. Inside `WithLaunchSettings` you:\n\n1. Call `builder.GetOrAddAnnotation\u003cLaunchProfileAnnotation\u003e()` (same helper used by `WithEndpoint` to create/update endpoint metadata) to obtain the current launch-profile payload or create a new one. ([learn.microsoft.com][11])\n2. Wrap that payload in a lightweight `LaunchProfileBuilder` that simply forwards each fluent call (`ApplicationUrl`, `Environment`, …) to set properties on the underlying annotation object, mirroring the fields documented for launch profiles. ([learn.microsoft.com][12])\n3. Invoke the user-supplied delegate so callers can chain mutations, then return the original `IResourceBuilder\u003cProjectResource\u003e` for further DSL composition. This parallels the design of `WithEnvironment`, ensuring deferred execution until the app-model is serialized. ([learn.microsoft.com][13])\n4. At build time the orchestrator already reads `LaunchProfileAnnotation` when it wires up process start-info, so no additional runtime code is needed—the new annotation just slots into that pipeline. ([learn.microsoft.com][14])\n\nBecause the method is an extension on `IResourceBuilder\u003cProjectResource\u003e` it compiles for every project resource yet stays invisible to containers, in exactly the same way that `WithReplicas` scopes itself. ([learn.microsoft.com][15])\n\n---\n\n## Risks\n\n* **API surface creep** – adds a new builder type, but aligns with existing extension-method pattern ([[apisof.net](https://apisof.net/catalog/8727891aef3d4a57985d393ded635fe5?fx=net46)][5]).\n* **Conflict resolution** – if both `launchProfileName` and `WithLaunchSettings` modify the same project, delegate wins; docs must state precedence clearly ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/launch-profiles)][1]).\n* **Tooling parity** – Visual Studio templates still emit JSON; guidance must note that code overrides file values at runtime ([[learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/networking-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)][4]).\n\n[1]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/launch-profiles \".NET Aspire and launch profiles - .NET Aspire | Microsoft Learn\"\n[2]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.projectresourcebuilderextensions.addproject?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0 \"ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.AddProject Method (Aspire.Hosting) | Microsoft Learn\"\n[3]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/app-host-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"NET Aspire orchestration overview - Learn Microsoft\"\n[4]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/networking-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"NET Aspire inner loop networking overview - Learn Microsoft\"\n[5]: https://apisof.net/catalog/8727891aef3d4a57985d393ded635fe5?fx=net46 \".NET API Catalog\"\n[6]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withenvironment?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0 \"ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEnvironment Method (Aspire.Hosting) | Microsoft Learn\"\n[7]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withargs?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0 \"ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithArgs Method (Aspire.Hosting) | Microsoft Learn\"\n[8]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.projectresourcebuilderextensions.withreplicas?view=dotnet-aspire-9.2\u0026utm_source=chatgpt.com \"ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReplicas Method (Aspire ...\"\n[9]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withendpoint?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0\u0026utm_source=chatgpt.com \"ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEndpoint Method (Aspire.Hosting)\"\n[10]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.applicationmodel.projectresource?view=dotnet-aspire-8.0 \"ProjectResource Class (Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel) | Microsoft Learn\"\n[11]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withendpoint?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0 \"ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEndpoint Method (Aspire.Hosting) | Microsoft Learn\"\n[12]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/launch-profiles \".NET Aspire and launch profiles - .NET Aspire | Microsoft Learn\"\n[13]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.resourcebuilderextensions.withenvironment?view=dotnet-aspire-9.0 \"ResourceBuilderExtensions.WithEnvironment Method (Aspire.Hosting) | Microsoft Learn\"\n[14]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.applicationmodel.launchprofileannotation?view=dotnet-aspire-9.2\u0026viewFallbackFrom=dotnet-aspire-8.0\u0026utm_source=chatgpt.com \"LaunchProfileAnnotation Class (Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel)\"\n[15]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.projectresourcebuilderextensions.withreplicas?view=dotnet-aspire-9.2\u0026utm_source=chatgpt.com \"ProjectResourceBuilderExtensions.WithReplicas Method (Aspire ...\"",

I believe the issue stems from changes introduced in this update.\n\nPreviously, I was able to access the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` of the AppHost and use that value directly as the URL. However, this approach no longer works.\n\nAfter experimenting with a few alternatives, I found that I could use the following code:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = await DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.CreateAsync\u003cAppHost\u003e();\nvar app = await builder.BuildAsync();\n\nawait app.StartAsync();\n\nvar hostUrl = app.GetEndpoint(\"aspire-dashboard\");\n```\n\nThe problem is that `hostUrl` differs from the URL printed in the console logs. This difference breaks compatibility with tools like OpenTelemetry (OTel) as well.\n\nUltimately, the absence of certain default values has caused the automation to fail.\n",

Only one project gets generated `IProjectMedatada` class. I have to manually define the class for the other project.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should use the relative path (physical path in disk or logical path in solution, probably as namespace) of the generated `IProjectMetadata` implementation for each of the projects allowing me to add both projects resources.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a .NET Aspire Empty App\n2. Create a new ASP.NET Core Web App inside a subfolder `WebApp1`\n3. Rename the ASP.NET Core Web App created in step 2 to `WebApp`.\n4. Add reference to this project in aspire app host.\n5. Create another new ASP.NET Core Web App inside a subfolder `WebApp2`\n6. Rename the ASP.NET Core Web App created in step 5 to `WebApp`.\n7. Add reference to this project in aspire app host.\n8. Try adding the resource in app host\u0027s `Program.cs` for both.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_None_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.301\n Commit:            a596cd22e2\n Workload version:  9.0.300-manifests.07067f5b\n MSBuild version:   17.14.5+edd3bbf37\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.301\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [android]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    35.0.61/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.android\\35.0.61\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.51/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\9.0.51\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maccatalyst]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.9288/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst\\18.4.9288\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [ios]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.9288/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.ios\\18.4.9288\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [aspire]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    8.2.2/8.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\8.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.aspire\\8.2.2\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.6\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       3875b54e7b\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.206 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.301 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n\n### Anything else?\n\nVersion of .NET Aspire from nuget package is `9.3.0`",

In my main apphost, these resources are marked as `.WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)`, but for my tests I wanted to turn off all container persistence to ensure the tests are isoalted from each other.\n\nI was attemptign to do this through a `BeforeStartEvent` subscription, but on further investigation it appears that the `DcpInstancesAnnotation` has been already been assigned to the resource by the time my event handler runs.  So even if I remove the Lifetime annotation at this point, it is a bit late as DCP has already processed it.\n\nShould this annotation be assigned to resources after `BeforeStartEvent`s have been processed to give consumers a chance to modify these values before DCP locks in it\u0027s naming decision - https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/cb9d231f82f7d8a6971954c21b4808259388ab91/src/Aspire.Hosting/DistributedApplicationBuilder.cs#L371 .\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8b1054a-aa92-49cf-8200-afe2d11f64f2)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI should be able to change whether a container is persistent or now in `BeforeStartEvent`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI\u0027d expect the following to start two containers, not for both tests to re-use the same container.\n\n```cs\n// NUnit\n[assembly: Parallelizable(ParallelScope.All)]\n\npublic class WebTests\n{\n    [TestCase(1)]\n    [TestCase(2)]\n    public async Task Test(int instance)\n    {\n        var builder = DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.Create();\n        DisablePersistentContainers(builder);\n\n        var sql = builder.AddSqlServer(\"sql\")\n            .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);\n\n        var app = builder.Build();\n\n        await app.StartAsync();\n        await Task.Delay(120_000);\n    }\n\n    private static IDistributedApplicationBuilder DisablePersistentContainers(IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder)\n    {\n        builder.Eventing.Subscribe\u003cBeforeStartEvent\u003e((evt, ct) =\u003e\n        {\n            foreach (var resource in evt.Model.Resources.OfType\u003cContainerResource\u003e())\n            {\n                foreach (var lifetimeAnnotation in resource.Annotations.OfType\u003cContainerLifetimeAnnotation\u003e().ToArray())\n                {\n                    resource.Annotations.Remove(lifetimeAnnotation);\n                }\n                foreach (var proxySupport in resource.Annotations.OfType\u003cProxySupportAnnotation\u003e().ToArray())\n                {\n                    resource.Annotations.Remove(proxySupport);\n                }\n            }\n            return Task.CompletedTask;\n        });\n\n        return builder;\n    }\n\n}\n      return builder;\n   }\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\nReproed on both 9.3.0 and 9.4.0-preview.1.25329.2\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

If this support was added natively as a configuration provider, then it might be easier to pull these values in to map to the resource\u0027s env vars.\n\n## Risks\n\nN/A\n",

        "body":  "Parameters have a bunch of usability and ergonomics issues today that we should consider when we revisit them:\n\n- Parameters are currently hidden in the dashboard by default. Since 9.4 you can view hidden resources which shows parameters but they have a state of \"Unknown\" and their values aren\u0027t shown in the dashboard resource details.\n- No nice APIs for adding a generated password parameter to the model. Instead one needs to discovery and call `ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.CreateDefaultPasswordParameter` then pass the result into `builder.AddResource` which results in the parameter not being hidden. We should likely have an overload of `builder.AddParameter` or something like `builder.AddPasswordParameter`\n- It\u0027s too easy to access the value of parameter resources from code thanks to the `Value` property in ways which aren\u0027t compatible with publishing, and there\u0027s nothing that warns you. We should consider making the `Value` property throw when in publish mode, or even getting rid of the property and forcing other call sites to support accepting the parameters in a first-class way, etc.\n- No way to specify the type of value expected in a parameter or validate the value. We have cases where we validate non-parameter values in run mode and throw if they\u0027re invalid, but if you get the value via a parameter the value isn\u0027t validated at all. We should consider adding support for known parameter data types, e.g. integer, URI, connection string, etc., and that preserve in the model during publish. Or even just being able to specify a description for a parameter so that it can be included in the manifest, etc.",

Leaving out the reference compiles, but the ApiService will not be able to call the container like\n```cs\nbuilder.Services.AddHttpClient(\"test\", client =\u003e\n    {\n        client.BaseAddress = new(\"http://test\");\n    });\n//...\nawait client.GetStringAsync(\"/\"); //cannot connect to host \"test\"\n```\n\n\nI need to do a workaround like \n\n```cs\npublic static class AspireBuilderExtensions\n{\n    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cContainerServiceResource\u003e AddContainerService(this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder, [ResourceName] string name, string? image = null, string? tag = null)\n    {\n        var res = new ContainerServiceResource(name);\n        var service = builder.AddResource(res);\n        if (image is not null)\n            service.WithImage(image, tag);\n        return service;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ContainerServiceResource : ContainerResource, IResourceWithServiceDiscovery\n{\n    public ContainerServiceResource(string name, string? entrypoint = null) : base(name, entrypoint)\n    {\n    }\n}\n\n// ...\n\nvar test = builder.AddContainerService(\"test\", \"caddy\")\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 80);\nvar api = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.ApiService\u003e(\"apiservice\")\n    .WithReference(test);\n\n```\n\nand then I can successfully call the container.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n`ContainerResource` should inherit `IResourceWithServiceDiscovery` by default, or make it so after adding an endpoint this works:\n\n```cs\nvar test = builder.AddContainer(\"test\", \"caddy\")\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(targetPort: 80);\nvar api = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.ApiService\u003e(\"apiservice\")\n    .WithReference(test);\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "Add support for executing commands in container resources, i.e. equivalent of `docker exec`.\n\n## In the dashboard\n\nAll container resources get a new command like \"Execute command...\" that when selected pops a dialog using the interaction service that prompts for the command to execute (required) and the working directory in the container to execute it in (optional, defaults to root). Once accepted the command is executed in the resource\u0027s container (via existing DCP exec functionality that needs to be hooked up to `Aspire.Hosting` I believe). Logs from the execution should be output to the resource\u0027s logs.\n\nThe command should only be enabled when the container is running (unhealthy is fine).\n\nIt would be great if we could auto-navigate to the resource logs page once the command prompt is submitted so that the execution and output of the command is immediately visible to the user.\n\n## In `Aspire.Hosting`\n\nA new API is added to allow easily adding a pre-defined exec command to any container resource:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"mycontainer\",\n    .WithExecCommand(\"sh -c \\\"hello from inside the container!\\\"\", \"Echo hello\");\n```\n\nIt should be based on the API signature of the `WithCommand` and `WithHttpCommand` methods, accepting required info as parameters and then a `CommandOptions` or if suitable a custom derived `ExecCommandOptions` for all the other info (icon, etc.), e.g.:\n\n```csharp\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithExecCommand\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder builder, string command, string displayName, string? workingDir = null, string? commandName = null, ExecCommandOptions? commandOptions = null)\n    where T : ContainerResource;\n```\n\nAdditionally, an API that exposes the actual capability to perform the container exec should be publicly available so that any custom command or code otherwise running in the AppHost can perform a container exec when it needs to, e.g. `ContainerExecService`.\n\n## In the `aspire` CLI\n\nThe Aspire CLI\u0027s `exec` command will be updated to support executing commands in containers. This should feel similar to using the `exec` command for executing a command in the context of a project resource, but this time rather than simply getting the configuration of the resource applied to the command, the command itself will be executed inside the container:\n\n```\n$ aspire exec --resource mycontainer sh -c \"hello from inside the container!\"\n```\n\nThe command should start the AppHost, ensure the target container resource is running (along with all of its dependencies) before executing the command and streaming the output back to the terminal, and exit using the exit code of the command inside the container.\n\nIt should be possible to set the working directory inside the container via a `-w/--workdir` option, e.g.:\n\n```\n$ aspire exec --resource mycontainer --workdir /some/dir ls -r\n```\n",

Please describe the problem.**\n\nFrom the discussion in PR #10038, we identified a need for an `InteractionInput.InputType` that presents a list of possible choices (suggested values), but also allows users to enter arbitrary text. This would be especially useful for scenarios like Azure Subscription selection, where a user might want to pick from commonly used subscriptions but also needs the flexibility to input any valid subscription ID manually.\n\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\n\nExtend `InteractionInput.InputType` to support a hybrid mode where:\n- Users are shown a list of suggestions.\n- Users can type in a value that is not part of the suggestions.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nUse case example: Prompting for Azure Subscription—show known subscriptions as suggestions but allow the user to input any subscription ID (not limited to the list). This addition would improve flexibility and usability for similar scenarios.\n",

        "body":  "- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n**Describe the bug**\nThere is an interesting side effect after the recent change to make parameters and connection strings visible in the dashboard. Parameters are not appearing as \"related resources\" in the graph view—they are shown as isolated nodes (\"islands\"). See the attached image for a visual example.\n\nIt appears that various resources need to call `WithReferenceRelationship` to ensure parameters are correctly recognized as related resources and properly connected in the graph view.\n\n\n```c#\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar pwd = builder.AddParameter(\"pwd\", secret: true);\n\nvar cache = builder.AddRedis(\"cache\").WithPassword(pwd);\n\nvar apiService = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.RedisApp_ApiService\u003e(\"apiservice\")\n    .WithHttpHealthCheck(\"/health\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.RedisApp_Web\u003e(\"webfrontend\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithHttpHealthCheck(\"/health\")\n    .WithReference(cache)\n    .WaitFor(cache)\n    .WithReference(apiService)\n    .WaitFor(apiService);\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nParameters should be connected as related resources where relevant, rather than appearing as isolated nodes.\n\n**Steps To Reproduce**\n1. Make parameters visible in the dashboard.\n2. Observe the graph view: parameters are not connected to other resources.\n3.

        "body":  "We should support declaring descriptions and validation for parameter values. These would be hooked up to the prompt for parameter values on the dashboard and integrated into the publish/deploy experience. All current locations where parameter values are manually validated and an exception is thrown if the value is invalid would instead be handled centrally via the parameter system itself (i.e. parameter values would be validated during initialization and accessing `GetValueAsync()` or `Value` on a parameter would auto-throw an exception with the validation issue details).\n\nWe should consider simply using the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationAttribute` types in the BCL (along with the `Validator.TryValidateValue` method). Open question as to whether we wrap this with an interface and adapter to enable other kinds of validation to be used (similar to MVC). It might be nice to allow custom validation to be implemented as an inline lambda passed to builder methods but we could still support that via a custom `ValidationAttribute` (or just directly, e.g. `Func\u003cstring?, ValidationResult\u003e`) rather than introduce a new abstraction.\n\nHow it might look:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddParameter(\"service-url\")\n    .WithDescription(\"The URL for the service.\")\n    .WithValidation(new StringLengthAttribute(255) { MinimumLength = 5 })\n    .WithValidation(value =\u003e\n    {\n        if (!Uri.TryCreate(value, UriKind.Absolute, our var uri)\n            || !string.Equals(uri.PathAndQuery, \"/\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)\n            || !string.IsNullOrEmpty(uri.Fragment)\n            || !string.Equals(uri.Scheme, \"https\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) {\n                return new ValidationResult(\"Value for parameter {0} must be an absolute root HTTPS URL.\");\n        }\n        return ValidationResult.Success;\n    });\n```\n\n",

        "body":  "## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nImproving the authoring experience for custom resources in Aspire. There are friction points with `WithInitialState` and `ResourceNotificationService.PublishUpdateAsync`.\n\n### Current usage example\n\n**WithInitialState:**\n```csharp\n.WithInitialState(new()\n{\n    ResourceType = \"ClockHand\",\n    CreationTimeStamp = DateTime.UtcNow,\n    State = KnownResourceStates.NotStarted,\n    Properties =\n    [\n        new(CustomResourceKnownProperties.Source, \"Talking Clock\")\n    ]\n});\n```\n\n**Pain point:**\n- `CreationTimeStamp` should default to `DateTime.UtcNow` so you don\u0027t have to specify it for every resource.\n- Marking resource as hidden should be easier - https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/6138\n- Resources should have default friendly names - https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/5555\n\n**ResourceNotificationService.PublishUpdateAsync:**\n```csharp\nawait notificationService.PublishUpdateAsync(parameterResource, s =\u003e\n{\n    return s with\n    {\n        State = new(stateText, KnownResourceStateStyles.Error),\n        Properties = s.Properties.SetResourceProperty(KnownProperties.Parameter.Value, ex.Message)\n    };\n})\n.ConfigureAwait(false);\n```\n\nUpdates over IResource are a set of immutable snapshots of type [`CustomResourceSnapshot`](src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/CustomResourceSnapshot.cs). The caller is given the previous update in a callback and they should apply a transformation to that to send a new update.\n\n**Pain points:**\n1. `Properties` is a loosely-typed bag ([CustomResourceSnapshot.cs](src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/CustomResourceSnapshot.cs)), and there are no public helpers for setting them. We need to make [`CustomResourceSnapshotExtensions`](src/Shared/CustomResourceSnapshotExtensions.cs) public so that resource authors have ergonomic helpers.\n2. Setting custom properties on resources will not make them show up in the dashboard details view. Authors should be able to mark properties as \"important\" (e.g. `IsImportant=true`) to have them show up in dashboard details by default. This could be added as a boolean property to `ResourcePropertySnapshot`.\n\n## Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n1. Make `CreationTimeStamp` auto-default to `DateTime.UtcNow` in `WithInitialState` if not set.\n2. Make `CustomResourceSnapshotExtensions` public to provide helpers for managing resource properties.\n3. Add an `IsImportant` boolean property to `ResourcePropertySnapshot` so that custom resource properties can be surfaced in the dashboard details view by default.\n\n- Related to https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/1644\n\nThese improvements will make creating and updating custom resources more ergonomic and predictable, and help authors build better Aspire experiences.\n\n## Additional context\n\n- [`TalkingClockResource`](playground/CustomResources/CustomResources.AppHost/TalkingClockResource.cs)\n- [`CustomResourceSnapshot`](src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/CustomResourceSnapshot.cs)\n- [`CustomResourceSnapshotExtensions`](src/Shared/CustomResourceSnapshotExtensions.cs)\n",

        "body":  "- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.**\nWe would like to add support for representing progress as a first class state for resources. Currently, there is no clear way to indicate that a resource is undergoing some operation when the duration or completion percentage is unknown, or when partial progress is known (e.g., a file download).\n\n*Today, two resources implement progress status updates as human-readable text:*\n\n1. **Ollama in the community toolkit** ([OllamaUtilities.cs](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire/blob/1df114f181f83540e0e50cfb1b12c82d1ab7d034/src/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Ollama/OllamaUtilities.cs))\n2. **AI Foundry Local** ([AzureAIFoundryExtensions.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/e026c5d5dc631a1213e644582d6e466f75ec45c6/src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry/AzureAIFoundryExtensions.cs))\n\nBoth resources update the status by publishing notification strings like `\"Downloading {model} {percentage}%\"`, rather than using a structured progress field. This is a workaround due to the absence of first-class progress/percentage support in the resource state model.\n\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\nAdd new states to resources that support both indeterminate progress (something is happening but we don\u0027t know how long it will take) and percentage-based progress (we know the current percent complete, e.g., model or file download). This would help consumers of the resource understand that work is in progress and, when possible, see how much is left to complete.\n\n**Additional context**\nThis issue is to track the discussion and implementation of these new resource states (indeterminate and percentage-based progress).\n",

This warning is hard to find or not shown at all when running an Aspire AppHost. We should use the Interaction Service to show a banner in the dashboard when this situation is detected with an action button that when clicked shows a prompt with instructions on what will happen (i.e. the OS will launch its own dialog) and a button that when clicked attempts to trust the dev cert.\n\nThis improves the situation of someone running an Aspire app when the dev cert is present but not trusted by leading them actively through the steps to rectify the situation.\n\nWe can consider shelling out to `dotnet dev-certs https --check --trust` to perform the detection of whether of the cert is trusted, and `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` to perform the actual trust operation.

        "body":  "Aspire currently does not support optional parameters, which can limit flexibility when integrating or extending Aspire components. Adding support for optional parameters would allow developers to provide more concise and expressive code, improve interoperability, and reduce boilerplate.\n\n**Scenario Example:**\nIn @dotnet/eShop/pull/858, configuration for either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI relies on parameters. For Azure OpenAI, the Endpoint is required, while the Key is optional. For OpenAI, only the Key is required because the Endpoint is already known. However, when both parameters are defined, users are repeatedly prompted to fill in \"optional\" parameters, even if they aren\u0027t needed for the selected configuration.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n- Review key APIs and configuration points in Aspire for places where optional parameters would provide value.\n- Update method signatures to include optional parameters using default values, ensuring API stability and backward compatibility.\n- Allow parameters to be left blank when not required by the scenario, preventing unnecessary reprompting.\n- Add tests to verify behavior when optional parameters are omitted or specified.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Increased flexibility and ease-of-use for consumers of Aspire APIs.\n- Reduced need for multiple overloads or verbose configuration.\n- Alignment with modern C# coding practices.\n\n**Risks and Considerations:**\n- Ensure backward compatibility for existing consumers.\n- Document all changes thoroughly in API docs and changelogs.\n\nPlease discuss specific scenarios or APIs where this enhancement is most needed, or provide examples from your usage.\n",

This does not seem to be handled well by Aspire service discovery. Observed problems with YARP proxy integration.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a new Aspire starter application.\n2. Add another web API project (let\u0027s call it \"auxapi1\") and hook it up to Aspire application host.\n3. To be able to easily distinguish between the API services in the app, I added an \"info\" request handler to both:\n\n```csharp\napp.MapGet(\"/info\", () =\u003e\n{\n    return new\n    {\n        Name = \"ApiService\",\n        Version = \"1.0.0\",\n        Description = \"This is the main API service.\" // Change as necessary\n    };\n}).WithName(\"GetInfo\");\n```\n\n4. Add a reference to Aspire.Hosting.Yarp package and add the following code to app host:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddYarp(\"yarp\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithConfiguration(yc =\u003e\n    {\n        var e1 = auxapi1.GetEndpoint(\"http\");\n        yc.AddRoute(\"/api1/info\", e1).WithTransformPathSet(\"/info\");\n        var e3 = apiService.GetEndpoint(\"http\");\n        yc.AddRoute(\"/api/info\", e3).WithTransformPathSet(\"/info\");\n    });\n```\n\n5. Run the app, open YARP endpoint and try hitting `\u003cyarp endpoint\u003e/api/info` and `\u003cyarp endpoint\u003e/api1/info`\n\nObserve that the original API can be reached, but the new API cannot, because YARP is rewriting `localhost` to `host.docker.internal` (default host for container-based services, which YARP is).\n\n6. Remove the call to `UseHttpsRedirection()` from the code of the new API service. Repeat step 5 and observe that YARP redirection now works for both API services.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\nUsed Aspire 9.4.0-preview.1.25368.7 (newest today).\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

I tried two ways and in both cases YARP tried to find the endpoint on its inner container network, which obviously failed. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create Aspire starter app\n2. Start a \"hello world\" type of HTTP service listening on localhost address, port 8080 (change port as necessary).\n3. Add the following to the app code\n\n```csharp\nvar hellow = builder.AddExternalService(\"hellow\", \"http://localhost:8080\");\n\n\nbuilder.AddYarp(\"yarp\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithConfiguration(yc =\u003e\n    {\n        var c = yc.AddCluster(hellow); // Also tried using hellow directly, which also compiles and runs\n        yc.AddRoute(\"/hellow/{**catchall}\", c).WithTransformPathRemovePrefix(\"/hellow\");\n\n    });\n```\n\n4. Start the app and try to hit the YARP endpoint path `/hellow`. YARP returns 502 Bad Gateway. In the error logs you will find that it tires to connect to \"localhost:8080\" (on the CONTAINER loopback device, not on host) and does not find anything listening on that address/port combination.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

We might need to special case external urls that are pointing to the host.\n\nThis is a very good edge case. We invented [HostUrl](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/261532e38fe46681da1478c71f176cc77e48f219/src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/HostUrl.cs#L10) for this purpose. \n\nWhat it means it that today if you pass an external service pointing at localhost to a container, there is no way for that container to reach the external service...\n\ncc @DamianEdwards ",

I have defined the configuration for kestrel like any other asp.net project:\n\n```JSON\n\"Kestrel\": {\n  \"Endpoints\": {\n    \"HttpsInlineCertStore\": {\n      \"Url\": \"https://localhost:17012\",\n      \"Certificate\": {\n        \"Subject\": \"my cert\u0027s subject\",\n        \"Store\": \"My\",\n        \"Location\": \"CurrentUser\",\n        \"AllowInvalid\": true\n      }\n    }\n  }\n},\n```\nBut doing so, causes the app host to crash on start.\n\nIs this behavior by design, that the usage of own certificates in development is not permitted, or there is some workaround to achive the result?\n\nThank you\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt is possible to run with any valid https certificate for the aspire app host\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAs descibed above, add the Kestrel configuration to appsettings.Development.json andd start the host\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Sequence contains more than one element\n         at System.Linq.ThrowHelper.ThrowMoreThanOneElementException()\n         at System.Linq.Enumerable.TryGetSingle[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source, Boolean\u0026 found)\n         at System.Linq.Enumerable.Single[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source)\n         at Aspire.Hosting.Dashboard.DashboardServiceHost.Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService.StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) in /_/src/Aspire.Hosting/Dashboard/DashboardServiceHost.cs:line 211\n         at Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host.\u003cStartAsync\u003eb__14_1(IHostedService service, CancellationToken token)\n         at Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host.ForeachService[T](IEnumerable`1 services, CancellationToken token, Boolean concurrent, Boolean abortOnFirstException, List`1 exceptions, Func`3 operation)\nUnhandled exception.

The other option would be probably to setup additional reverse proxy for the otel endpoint. is it reasonable, or there are other options?",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\n\nWe should consider aligning the APIs for dotnet with JS/Python - and removing the need for project references. We would have to handle any code gen or build ordering that dotnet itself handles via the projectrefs now.\n\nIt would be great to have dotnet line up w the other langs -- we can still enable the powerful dotnet experience we have today but with a unified API. This also solves one of my personal gripes of having to mess around with project references by hand in vs code lol.\n\nAdditionally, this would work with single file apps!!!! YAY\n\n## Proposed API\n\nPlease provide the specific public API signature diff that you are proposing. For example:\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting;\n\n- public static ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder\u003cApplicationModel.ProjectResource\u003e AddProject\u003cTProject\u003e(\n- this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder\n- string name\n- string projectPath);\n+ public static ApplicationModel.IResourceBuilder\u003cApplicationModel.DotnetAppResource\u003e AddDotnetApp(\n+ this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,\n+ string name,\n+ string projectFilePath); (could overload for string csharpFilePath or something)\n\n```\n\n## Risks\n\nDefinitely gonna require work across the stack. Obsoleting an API  that _everyone_ uses is pretty messy, too, but we should do this before it\u0027s too late lol\n",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nFor local development, currently volumes created by Aspire have a cryptic name, like `1ad80f9e6e2e77f45a9048408a42d05443f19afde9068cff853c197f96263924`.\nIt makes it difficult to associate Aspire-managed volumes with their corresponding projects and services/containers.\n\nMy current use case was to find and delete the data volume of my PostgreSQL to reset my database to scratch. It was not trivial.\n\nCompare this to e.g. compose, where the volumes are neatly named:\n\n```\n➜ podman volume ls\nDRIVER      VOLUME NAME\n\n# compose\nlocal       keycloak-configuration_postgres_data\nlocal       keycloak-configuration_extension\nlocal       keycloak-configuration_themes\nlocal       keycloak-configuration_keycloak-data\n\n# aspire\nlocal       ticketshop.aspire.apphost-f247ba5932-storage-data\nlocal       c14567a276c416bcfde5416f02236ad335c61855fc90f2a28d1b247adcac3448\nlocal       2d98a89734ea8da42197762aa4fe8cbfa3618f5bc8687fb6192b1199ac88de9e\nlocal       47b587610267bcf347d3d85d3224f0f11ecef4c94bbe6dabfea3d92eb9d296cf\nlocal       c643be77f7244a407b4cbbd8f1ed138f61aec4c9a65a88fdef4184fedd7d8d08\nlocal       de37fcd4092519b1b6f5a2efd9322093bdd026d95e45ea83b1cf39396f636301\nlocal       8def9f74cc5295ca9185f8a019f6903f274954f544e33bc79b556dc8cdfec10b\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nFollow a naming schema for the volumes. I suggest something along the lines of `aspire-[project-name]-[service-name]-[voluma-name-or-usage]`, e.g. `aspire-ticketshop-postgres-data` or `aspire-ticketshop-azurite-data`.\n\n### Additional context\n\nTo me, it\u0027d be a bonus if there was a trivial way to remove all Aspire-managed volumes for a given project, like `podman compose down -v` does. Like a `Hard-reset this project` action in the Aspire dashboard.",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\n\nCurrently, .NET Aspire provides mechanisms for configuring container resources, but there is no direct API to specify container labels. Labels are widely used in containerized environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to provide metadata for images and running containers. This metadata is valuable for purposes such as:\n\n* **Operational metadata**: e.g., who owns a container or when it was built.\n* **Integration with other systems**: e.g., CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, or logging tools that rely on labels.\n* **Organizing and filtering resources**: e.g., grouping containers by environment, service, or feature.\n\nWhile `.NET` project containers support labels through MSBuild and container publishing settings [\u003cContainerLabel\u003e](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/containers/publish-configuration#containerlabel), there is no general-purpose API to apply labels to **any** container resource defined in Aspire.\n\nThis proposal introduces a `WithLabel` (and optionally `WithLabels`) extension method for `IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e` where `T : ContainerResource`. This will give developers a simple, consistent way to attach labels at the Aspire container level.\n\n---\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting;\n\npublic static class ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions\n{\n+    /// \u003csummary\u003e\n+    /// Adds a container label to the container resource.\n+    /// \u003c/summary\u003e\n+    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithLabel\u003cT\u003e(\n+        this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder,\n+        string key,\n+        string value) where T : ContainerResource;\n+\n+    /// \u003csummary\u003e\n+    /// Adds multiple container labels to the container resource.\n+    /// \u003c/summary\u003e\n+    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithLabels\u003cT\u003e(\n+        this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder,\n+        IDictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e labels) where T : ContainerResource;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\n// Add a single label\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"my-service\", \"nginx:latest\")\n       .WithLabel(\"com.example.service\", \"my-service\");\n\n// Add multiple labels\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"my-service\", \"nginx:latest\")\n       .WithLabels(new Dictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e\n       {\n           [\"com.example.service\"] = \"my-service\",\n           [\"com.example.environment\"] = \"staging\",\n           [\"com.example.owner\"] = \"team-xyz\"\n       });\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that all containers, regardless of whether they originate from .NET projects or external images, can be tagged with custom labels.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n* **Single method with params overload:** Instead of having `WithLabel` and `WithLabels`, a single method could accept `params (string key, string value)[]`. However, this is less clear and requires allocation of tuples.\n\n* **Builder-style API:** Another option would be an object for building metadata (e.g., `.ConfigureLabels(l =\u003e l.Add(...))`). While more flexible for future extensions, it is overkill for the common simple key-value label pattern.\n\n* **MSBuild-only approach:** Labels could be configured for project-based containers via MSBuild, but this excludes non-.NET container resources, making the solution incomplete.\n\n* **Comparison to Docker Compose:** Docker Compose supports labels through a straightforward `labels` key:\n\n  ```yaml\n  services:\n    web:\n      image: nginx\n      labels:\n        com.example.service: \"my-service\"\n        com.example.environment: \"staging\"\n  ```\n\n  The proposed `WithLabel(s)` API mirrors this pattern, making it intuitive for developers already familiar with Compose or Dockerfile labels.\n\n---\n\n## Risks\n\n* **Consistency with other metadata APIs:** We need to ensure that the label API is aligned with existing Aspire configuration patterns for environment variables, ports, etc.\n* **Potential for conflicts:** If a label is set via both MSBuild and Aspire APIs, behavior must be clearly documented (e.g., Aspire overrides MSBuild or vice versa).\n* **Breaking changes:** None expected since this is additive.",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nWe are sharing a bunch of internal integrations for containerised version of our apps.  As our app is continuously delivered, we pretty much always want internal users using the latest version of our images, there are few options we could use to do this\n\n1. Reference the mutable tag (e.g. `latest` / `production` / `stable`)\n2. Use `WithImagePullPolicy(ImagePullPolicy.Always)`\n3. Use a fixed image tag / sha in our published component, and re-publish our integration package\n\nHowever each of these has drawbacks\n\n1. Referencing the `latest` tag will get you the `latest` container when you first run your app, but from then on it will keep on using the local version and won\u0027t ever update itself (unless someone explicitly re-pulls the image)\n2. `WithImagePullPolicy(ImagePullPolicy.Always)` will causes docker to fail to start if it cannot pull the image for any reason (no network, credential expired etc.)\n3. This only keeps the container up to date if consumers keep the nuget package up to date.  For continuously deployed apps, this could update the integration package several times a day which is a lot of updates - either manual or dependabot style prs).\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nSome kind of way that would allows us to try to get the up to date `latest` container, but allow falling back to a local one if you can\u0027t do so.\n\nSomething like the following would be awesome.\n```cs\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"redis\", \"redis\")\n    .WithImagePullPolicy(ImagePullPolicy.IfPossible)\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this won\u0027t be as simple as the existing pull policies - the current pull policies are somewhat standardized and are natively implemented in docker and kubernetes, so Aspire needs to do little more than pass an additional command line argument / yaml configuration\n\n- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy\n- https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#pull\n\nBut `IfPossible` would require Aspire doing a bit more clever work - My initial thought would be implementing of https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/5625#issuecomment-2614797582 - having aspire handle the image pull separately from starting the container.  In which case `IfPossible` would initially try to pull the image but continue on error.  The container could then start if the image is already in the local cache, or fail if it wasn\u0027t.\n\nFor publish, `IfPossible`, would likely need to translate to `missing` / `IfNotPresent`, meaning `IfPossible` only applies locally.\n\n### Additional context\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\n\nEnable Aspire resources to load environment variables from `.env` files and map them to Aspire parameters. This simplifies configuration and supports best practices for parameter management and secrets.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```csharp\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithEnvFile\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder)\n    where T : IResourceWithEnvironment;\n\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithEnvFile\u003cT\u003e(\n    this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder,\n    Action\u003cEnvEntry, IResourceBuilder\u003cParameterResource\u003e\u003e configure)\n    where T : IResourceWithEnvironment;\n```\n\n### EnvEntry Structure (Immutable)\n\n```csharp\npublic sealed class EnvEntry\n{\n    public string Key { get; }\n    public string? Value { get; }\n    public string? Comment { get; }\n\n    public EnvEntry(string key, string? value, string? comment)\n    {\n        Key = key;\n        Value = value;\n        Comment = comment;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Mapping Rules\n\n- By default, each `.env` entry is mapped to a non-secret parameter with the key and value.\n- Comments from the `.env` file are available via the `Comment` property on `EnvEntry`.\n- The second overload allows the user to customize:\n    - Whether a parameter is a secret (based on key name or custom logic)\n    - The parameter description or other metadata\n    - Skipping or modifying entries before mapping\n- **Parameter Name Uniqueness:**  \n  To ensure uniqueness for parameters originating from an `.env` file, the naming scheme should be `{resource}-env-{key}` (where `{resource}` is the logical name or ID of the resource and `{key}` is the environment variable key, lowercased). This avoids collisions across resources and makes the origin clear.\n    - Example: For resource `\"ui\"` and key `\"API_KEY\"`, the parameter name would be `\"ui-env-api_key\"`.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddNpmApp(\"ui\", \"../frontend\")\n       .WithEnvFile();\n\nbuilder.AddNpmApp(\"ui\", \"../frontend\")\n       .WithEnvFile((entry, paramBuilder) =\u003e\n       {\n           if (entry.Key.EndsWith(\"_SECRET\"))\n               paramBuilder.Resource.Secret = true;\n           paramBuilder.WithDescription(entry.Comment ?? $\"Imported from .env: {entry.Key}\");\n           // Parameter name will automatically be \"ui-env-{key.ToLowerInvariant()}\"\n       });\n```\n\n## Risks \u0026 Considerations\n\n- **File not found:** If `.env` is not found, nothing happens.\n- **Duplicate keys:** If duplicate keys exist, only the last one is used.\n- **Sensitive data:** Take care not to accidentally expose secrets.\n- **Error handling:** Consider adding logging or errors for malformed lines.\n- **Customization:** Users have full control via the callback to decide how each env entry is mapped.\n- **Parameter Naming:** Uniqueness is guaranteed by the `{resource}-env-{key}` (lowercased) scheme.\n- **Immutability:** `EnvEntry` is immutable for thread safety and reliability.\n\n---",

Both `Web` instances start immediately, report correct PIDs, and have Console output.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nI am trying to simulate in Aspire the fairly common deployment strategy of having some services deployed per-tenant in a multi-tenant application. For local dev w/ Aspire I\u0027m fine having 2 or 3 hard-coded \"tenants\" that start up services in Aspire, but it seems I can\u0027t reliably run multiple instances of the same project.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAspire should be able to run multiple instances of the same Project, and not lose track of them.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n\nReproduction repo: https://github.com/rally25rs/aspire-multi-instance-bug\n\nwhich is just `dotnet new aspire-starter` with a modified AppHost that tries to start 2 instances of the same project on different ports:\n\n```\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.aspire_multi_instance_bug_Web\u003e(\"webfrontend-1\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithEndpoint(\"http\", endpoint =\u003e endpoint.Port = 5284)\n    .WithEndpoint(\"https\", endpoint =\u003e endpoint.Port = 7056)\n    .WithHttpHealthCheck(\"/health\")\n    .WithReference(apiService)\n    .WaitFor(apiService);\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.aspire_multi_instance_bug_Web\u003e(\"webfrontend-2\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithEndpoint(\"http\", endpoint =\u003e endpoint.Port = 5285)\n    .WithEndpoint(\"https\", endpoint =\u003e endpoint.Port = 7057)\n    .WithHttpHealthCheck(\"/health\")\n    .WithReference(apiService)\n    .WaitFor(apiService);\n```\n\nClone the above repo and run aspire in debug from VSCode (press F5).\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.301\n Commit:            a596cd22e2\n Workload version:  9.0.300-manifests.9bcbba73\n MSBuild version:   17.14.5+edd3bbf37\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.5\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.301/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.6\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       3875b54e7b\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.401 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n  9.0.100-rc.1.24452.12 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n  9.0.301 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0-rc.1.24452.1 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.6 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.8 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0-rc.1.24431.7 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.6 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  None\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n* Aspire 9.4.0\n* VSCode\n* MacOS Sequoia 15.5",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nResource A should wait for completion of another resource B with `.WaitForCompletion()`.\nAdding a parent relationship to a project resource preserves this behaviour.  \nAdding a parent relationship to a contianer resource (in this case YARP) breaks this behaviour and resource A will immediately run. This also ignores the fact that resource A should not start up if resource B exits with an unexpected exit code.\nWe were able to reproduce the bug with another container resource (scalar) as well, so this seems to be tied to container resources.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nResource A waits for completion of resource B and only runs if resource B exits with the expected exit code.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n[I created a repository with steps to reproduce the bug here](https://github.com/backfromexile/Aspire9.4.0-WaitForCompletion-bug-repro)\nAdding `.WaitForCompletion()` to the YARP resource also fixes the bugged behaviour.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-preview.5.25277.114\n Commit:            ddf39a1b46\n Workload version:  10.0.100-preview.5.25306.3\n MSBuild version:   17.15.0-preview-25277-114+ddf39a1b4\n\nLaufzeitumgebung:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.22631\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-preview.5.25277.114\\\n\nInstallierte .NET-Workloads:\n [aspire]\n   Installation Source: SDK 10.0.100-preview.5, VS 17.14.36310.24\n   Manifest Version:    8.2.2/8.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\8.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.aspire\\8.2.2\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      10.0.0-preview.5.25277.114\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       ddf39a1b46\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  8.0.302 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.301 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.302 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  10.0.100-preview.5.25277.114 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.18 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.0-preview.5.25277.114 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.18 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.0-preview.5.25277.114 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.18 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.7 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 10.0.0-preview.5.25277.114 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "## Why\n\nMove project builds from individual csproj executions into the AppHost runtime to:\n\n- Defer builds until the AppHost starts, improving perceived startup.\n- Build all projects together in parallel, reducing total build time.\n- Let developers set per-project MSBuild properties from AppHost code/config instead of editing csproj files.\n- Support bulding projects when they are not in a solution tracked by the IDE (see https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/2154)\n\n## Design Overview\n\n- A single, hidden infrastructure resource in the AppHost performs one centralized build for all project resources.\n- All project resources implicitly wait for this build to complete successfully before they start.\n- Per-project MSBuild properties are attached to project resources (via annotations) and applied by the centralized build.\n- The build runs from a working directory under `obj/` and is not shown in manifests or user-facing UIs.\n\n## Public Surface (Top-level APIs)\n\nDevelopers configure build intent on each project. The build orchestrator remains hidden.\n\n- Project MSBuild properties:\n  - `WithMSBuildProperties(Action\u003cIDictionary\u003cstring,string\u003e\u003e configure)`\n  - `WithMSBuildProperties(IDictionary\u003cstring,string\u003e properties)`\n  - `WithMSBuildProperty(string name, string value)`\n\nBehavior notes:\n\n- Properties are merged per project; later values overwrite earlier ones for the same key.\n- No new CLI or config surface is required beyond usual AppHost composition.\n\n## Usage Examples (Hidden Resource)\n\nDevelopers do not reference the build resource directly. It runs once, before projects start.\n\n```csharp\n// AppHost composition\nvar api = builder.AddProject(\"src/Api/Api.csproj\")\n                 .WithMSBuildProperty(\"TreatWarningsAsErrors\", \"true\")\n                 .WithMSBuildProperties(p =\u003e\n                 {\n                     p[\"SelfContained\"] = \"true\";\n                     p[\"PublishSingleFile\"] = \"false\";\n                 });\n\nvar worker = builder.AddProject(\"src/Worker/Worker.csproj\")\n                    .WithMSBuildProperty(\"WarningsAsErrors\", \"NU1605;CS1591\");\n\n// The hidden build resource runs automatically before Api/Worker start.\n```\n\n## Behavioral Contract (What It Must Do)\n\n- Discover all project resources in the AppHost model at startup.\n- Collect per-project MSBuild properties attached via annotations.\n- Produce a single aggregate build input that includes all project resources and their properties.\n- Invoke one `dotnet build` for the aggregate, leveraging parallelism.\n- Ensure all project resources wait for the centralized build and only start after it succeeds.\n- Keep artifacts isolated under the AppHost’s `obj/` directory.\n- Remain hidden (infra-only) and idempotent across compositions.\n- Surface failures clearly and block dependent projects when the build fails.\n- Respect standard `Configuration`/`Platform` defaults unless overridden by the developer.\n\n## Scope and Non‑Goals\n\nIn scope:\n\n- Build and restore for AppHost project resources.\n- Per-project MSBuild property injection from AppHost code/config.\n\nOut of scope (initial):\n\n- Publish/pack/test orchestration, container builds, or non-MSBuild systems.\n- Advanced validation/encoding of arbitrary property names/values.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Starting the AppHost triggers one centralized build before any project resource runs.\n- Per-project MSBuild properties set in AppHost are honored by that build.\n- The build executes in parallel and succeeds when individual projects build successfully.\n- The build resource remains hidden from manifests and user-facing surfaces.\n- Developers can add/update project-specific MSBuild properties without touching csproj files.\n",

        "body":  "@karolz-ms @danegsta and I had a design conversation this morning about `AddContainerExecutable(...)` and `ContainerExecutableResource` and how it behaves in non-persistent and persistent scenarios. What follows is a capture of some API surface designs from that conversation.\n\n# Non-persistent scenarios\n\n## Basic usage\n\nThe first thing that we discussed is what is the expected behavior of `AddContainerExecutable(...)` when it is applied to a container resource in the following manner.\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n       .AddContainerExecutable(\"pull-model\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"pull\", \"llama2\"]);\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nIn this scenario DCP would start the Ollama container and as soon as it was running immediately start the container executable. It would not wait for the Ollama resource to become healthy because the assumption is that the container executable may influence the health of the parent resource.\n\n# Basic usage with `WaitFor(...)` and friends\n\n`ContainerExecutableResource` would also participate in the `WaitFor(...)` mechanics in Aspire. So it would be possible to do this:\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nvar ollama = builder.AddOllama(\"ollama\");\nollama.AddContainerExecutable(\"pull-model\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"pull\", \"llama2\"])\n      .WaitFor(ollama);\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nIn this scenario the `ContainerResourceExecutable` would not be started (the DCP resource would not be created) until the parent resource became healthy.\n\n# Basic usage with explicit start\n\n`ContainerResourceExecutable` would honor `WithExplicitStart(...)`. This is useful for scenarios where the container executable represents a command that you might want to do occasionally (like truncate a database) or hide behind a dashboard command and trigger via `ResourceCommandService`.\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n       .AddContainerExecutable(\"clear-models\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"rm\", \"-a\"])\n       .WithExplicitStart();\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\n# Persistent scenarios\n\n## Container executable with persistent parent container\n\nWhen `ContainerExecutableResource` is used with `ContainerResource` that has a persistent lifetime annotation, the default behavior is that the executable will run again each time the apphost starts, regardless of whether the container is reused or not. This will work well for commands which are idempotent.\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n       .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)\n       .AddContainerExecutable(\"pull-model\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"pull\", \"llama2\"]);\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\n## Controlling execution based on parent container reuse\n\nThere would be a new extension method called `WithPersistenceBehavior(...)` which is applied to `ContainerExecutableResource` builders which sets an annotation on the resource which controls how it behaves when containers are reused. Here is an example.\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n       .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)\n       .AddContainerExecutable(\"pull-model\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"pull\", \"llama2\"])\n       .WithPersistenceBehavior(PersistenceBehavior.SkipOnReuse);\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nThere would be two enumerated behaviors, `RunWhenReused`, `RunWhenNew`, and `RunAlways\u0027 (default)  - the enumerated names, extension methods etc are up for debate but the idea is that you might have commands that you want to execute depending on whether a container is fresh or not each time you start the app host.\n\nUnder the covers DCP would do house keeping to figure out whether specific command had been run against a container to determine whether it needs to run a specific command again. This would be similar to the fingerprinting mechanism that we have in DCP today for container reuse although @karolz-ms and @danegsta are considering what storage options we might have from this ranging from global container volumes which we `docker cp` state into to sqllite databases for tracking information. This would mostly be an implementation detail but some information my back-propogate into the app model.\n\n\u003e NOTE: When discussing with @karolz-ms and @danegsta we discussed reusing the method `WithLifetime(...)`. I\u0027ve used `WithPersistenceBehavior(...)` here - but we could make it with `WithLifetime(ContainerExecutableLifetime)`.\n\n## Persistent parent with WaitFor(...)\n\n`WaitFor(...)` would work as expected for persistent parents as well. Basically it would wait until the app model recognized the parent resource as being healthy and then trigger the execution of the container executable via DCP.\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nvar ollama = builder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n       .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);\nollama.AddContainerExecutable(\"pull-model\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"pull\", \"llama2\"])\n      .WaitFor(ollama);\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\n## Persistent parent with explicit start\n\nIf the parent resource is persistent, and the container executable is marked with explicit start, the container executable would not start unless explicitly started.\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n       .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)\n       .AddContainerExecutable(\"clear-models\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"rm\", \"-a\"])\n       .WithExplicitStart();\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\nIf combined with `WithPersistenceBehavior(...)` then this would be considered an error and throw!!!\n\n```csharp\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nbuilder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n       .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)\n       .AddContainerExecutable(\"clear-models\", \"ollama\", \"/\", [\"rm\", \"-a\"])\n       .WithExplicitStart()\n       .WithPersistenceBehavior(PersistenceBehavior.SkipOnReuse); // Should throw!\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n```\n\n# Deployment considerations\n\n## `ContainerExecutableResources` ... local first ... do not equal init containers\n\n`ContainerExecutableResource` is a local only concept which unlike their container parents does not automatically translate well to common target deployment environments.\n\nFor example `Azure Container Apps` does not support defining a container app which also specifies executables that launch after the main container has started. ACA and Kubernetes do however support init containers that allow the developer to specify containers that need to run and complete successfully before the specified container in the pod starts.\n\n`ContainerExecutableResource` IS NOT the same as an init container. An init container brings its own environment and optionally shares volumes with the container that will launch after it completes successfully. By contrast `ContainerExecutableResource` represents a command that runs INSIDE a container. Its an analogue to `docker exec` or `kubectl exec`.\n\nFor local development an extension developer may choose to provide extensibility functionality (such as installing plugins/installing models/creating databases) via `ContainerExexecutableResource` but they would need to find an alternative approach for deployment scenarios.\n\nFor example, if we had an API like `AddGrafana(string)` we might have extension methods like `WithPlugin(string)`. An example implementation for this would add annotations to the grafana resource to keep track of plugins that are registered, and then the apphost start it would dynamically add to `ContainerExecutableResource` resources to run the install commands.\n\nFor deployment, rather than doing plugin installs that way you might generate a Dockerfile for the container resource and add the install commands to the docker file. Avoiding the cost of doing a dockerfile build for local dev, but baking a container image for deployment purposes.",

I\u0027m thinking of `ContainerExecutableResource` as something that is local only - or at least the local implementation detail of something that could eventually be emitted into a Docker Compose file, a Kubernetes chart, or other environment.\n\nLet me elaborate. Today we have things like `WithHttpHealthCheck(...)`. When running locally this results in a check being added to the apphost which points to an endpoint on the resource (and an annotation on the resource itself). \n\nWe could enhance the `AddDockerComposeEnvironment(...)` behavior so that when it encountered a `HealthCheckAnnotation` it would translate that into a health check that does a CURL operation. We\u0027d probably need more structured data to support this.\n\nSimilarly we could introduce a `WithExecHealthCheck(...)` for `IResourceBuilder\u003cContainerResource\u003e` which would function similarly. It would register a check in the apphost DI which would access `ResourceCommandService` and `ResourceNotificationService` to trigger executions against the container resource and use the results as a health signal.\n\nBut this would be a very local implementation - there would be annotations in the app model which capture the details of the command that represents the health check and depending on whether you publish to Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or ~~Azure Container~~ Apps it would get translated.\n\nBut I see this as the next layer up in terms of implementation.",

This server will enable LLM-based tools to connect and query basic information about the running distributed application via streaming HTTP. The goal is to establish the core transport, lifecycle, and authentication model with a very small set of read-only tools to validate UX and gather feedback for future iterations.\n\n## Key Scenarios\n- Troubleshoot unhealthy services: Query health and stream logs for a resource.\n- Understand app topology: List resources with type and status, and primary endpoints (e.g., dashboard, Swagger).\n- Get app context: Minimal server/app info (name, environment, versions, dashboard URL).\n- Execute resource commands\n\n## Details\n- **Built-in:** Runs in-process in AppHost for direct access to app state.\n- **Configurable:** No new public API; enabled/disabled via configuration (single global toggle on `DistributedApplicationOptions`).\n- **Transport:** Streaming HTTP\n- **Authentication:** Required (loopback-only, bearer token, details TBD for preview).\n- **CLI:** Prints the MCP URL on startup (like Dashboard).\n- **Discovery file:** Optional minimal JSON file with MCP URL and token for tools (implementation detail; can be discussed).\n- **Initial tools:**\n  - `server.info` - minimal metadata and dashboard URL\n  - `resources.list` - resources state\n  - `logs.stream` - console log stream\n  - `commands.list` - commands that can be executed\n",

Two ideas:\n\n- Make `ToString()` on ReferenceExpressions throw / log an error, rather than ending up\n- An analyzer to detect when a Reference Expression is detected within a regular interpolated string. \n\n### Additional context\n\nFor anyone hitting the original issue, you can work around that by explicitly building a `ReferenceExpression`, and then referencing that.\n\n```cs\nvar migrations = builder.AddExecutable(\"dbMigrator\", \"sqlcmd\", packageDir)\n    .WithArgs(\n        \"-S\", serverExpresison,\n        \"-U\", \"sa\",\n        \"-P\", sql.Resource.PasswordParameter,\n        \"-i\", patchedUpgradeScriptPath\n    )\n```",

I don\u0027t think we can get Keycloak to change this for us.\n\nFor example `QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` instead of `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting;\n\npublic static class OtlpConfigurationExtensions\n{\n-        public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithOtlpExporter\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder) where T : IResourceWithEnvironment\n+        public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithOtlpExporter\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, string? prefix = null) where T : IResourceWithEnvironment\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```cs\nvar keycloak = builder.AddKeycloak(\"keycloak\", 5677, adminPassword: keycloakAdminPassword)\n    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)\n    .WithEnvironment(\"KC_DB\", \"mssql\")\n    .WithEnvironment(\"KC_DB_URL\", JdbcExpression.Create(keycloakDb))\n    .WithEnvironment(\"KC_DB_USERNAME\", \"SA\")\n    .WithEnvironment(\"KC_DB_PASSWORD\", keycloakDbPassword)\n    .WithEnvironment(\"KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME\", \"\")\n    .WithEnvironment(\"KC_TRACING_ENABLED\", \"true\")\n    .WithReference(keycloakDb)\n    .WaitFor(keycloakDb)\n    .WithOtlpExporter(\"quarkus\");\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nI\u0027m currently copying the code of `AddOtlpEnvironment(IResource resource, IConfiguration configuration, IHostEnvironment environment)` to implement this myself in my codebase.\n\n## Risks\n\nNo breaking changes 👍\n\n## Related\n\n* #6635\n\n---\n\nI\u0027m willing to provide a PR if this is a valid API change\n",

I\u0027ve seen the solutions used in projects like https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/tree/main/samples/Metrics and that seems... Like a tremendous amount of work on the part of the user for what amounts to setting an environment variable.\n\nIt\u0027d be better if Aspire just didn\u0027t try to overwrite the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` value if it was already specified here, rather than requiring a Manhattan Project\u0027s worth of Aspire internals knowledge or a third party plugin implementing the same.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Because these environment variable annotations are set when the project is created, they\u0027re applied before environment variables added by the user.\n\nFor example, if someone specifies `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` themselves then that is what is used:\n\n```cs\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.BrowserTelemetry_Web\u003e(\"web\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()\n    .WithEnvironment(\"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\", \"http://localhost:8081\");\n```\n\nResult is the user defined variable is used:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"701\" height=\"65\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e70086c-5a58-4258-9de2-d9ffc5fcd97d\" /\u003e\n\nWhich is confirmed to be passed to the resource by logging the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var value to the console:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"859\" height=\"154\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55501856-a521-42f4-a3a9-0b631b22e615\" /\u003e\n\nI think the only way the user defined value wouldn\u0027t be used is if the env var annotation was inserted before other annotations. You can do that, but it requires some ugly code:\n\n```cs\nvar p = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.BrowserTelemetry_Web\u003e(\"web\")\n    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();\np.Resource.Annotations.Insert(0, new EnvironmentCallbackAnnotation(c =\u003e c.EnvironmentVariables[\"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\"] = \"http://localhost:8081\"));\n```\n\nResult is the Aspire specified value is used over the user value:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"727\" height=\"69\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/139be685-d331-491f-82c9-3c59fe29da3b\" /\u003e\n\nWe could update Aspire to only set these values if they\u0027re not already set, but given env vars are always applied in a order, and default behavior is user setting with `WithEnvironment` already take prescence over defaults, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s nessessary.",

For example:\n\n```csharp\nthrow new DistributedApplicationException($\"The resource \u0027{resource.Name}\u0027 does not have a project metadata annotation.\");\n```\n\nThis will make exception messages clearer and easier to diagnose during troubleshooting.\n\n**Reference:**\n[ResourceContainerImageBuilder.cs#L254](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/src/Aspire.Hosting/Publishing/ResourceContainerImageBuilder.cs#L254)\n\nDrafted by Copilot.",

I got tired and resorted to working with DeployingCallbackAnnotation to get Aspire _deploy_ to push images to my registry. It was valuable spelunking, though, and I realized the SDK is capable of building images without Docker and _pushing_ them to the registry. I wish there were an easy way to skip the build on publish, as we\u0027re currently calling publish twice to _push_. I can add --no-build to the cli args, but then it\u0027s not generic enough to use with any IComputeResource. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll figure it out with a few more days of head scratching.

But I\u0027m probably missing the point that this is meant to be a project-specific implementation detail and not meant to be reusable or stuffed in a library.\n\nSo let me know if these would justify a feature request:\n- Should publishAsDockerCompose have a mechanism to push images? (I think not, since that\u0027s vendor-specific, and can be done via the SDK as I\u0027ve discovered and illustrated above)\n- Should `ResourceContainerImageBuilder` have a way to push images?\n- ???\n\nI briefly had something that looked like _ResourceContainerImagePusher_, but it was so similar to Builder that it made me sad. AND it didn\u0027t solve the problem that images were being built twice, AND multi-arch wasn\u0027t working (because the current Aspire tooling looks like it only allows a single platform to be specified). My method above just relies on dotnet using the project definition, but I could easily add any of the publish properties that pertain to containers.\n\n^^^ That\u0027s the full explanation about how I stumbled across the error in the OP...\n\nHope you\u0027re having a good day. 😀",

The development logic is not that far off from my production setup. (In this scenario, \"production\" is a Raspberry Pi 5, 4-node, Docker swarm cluster with hyper-converged storage for bonus points) (Believe it or not, I have all the capacity I need for my initial needs.) Imagine my excitement when Docker Compose publishing became available.  (Except swarm compose is slightly different (tangent another day)) I could _theoretically_ automate generating the Docker Compose as well. (Before, I would have to generate a manifest and then use Aspir8 to achieve the same thing). And then you tease me with this _deploy_ command on the Aspire CLI, suggesting that I could put all of the logic, including pushing built images to where they need to be, in my Aspire project and never have to touch the compose file again.\nThe last thing that I need to add is copying my compose and secrets to their swarm storage where I can then execute the stack command (I don\u0027t actually need to do this precisely, I could deploy the stack directly from my development machine, but then I\u0027ll be figuring into the aspire project as well(one shiny toy at a time please))\n\nThe reality is not far off from what I described above, but there are some pain points to be resolved.\n- Docker Compose output is not compatible with Swarm out of the box. Yes, swarm can (noisily) ignore specific keys, but others, like the long format of `depends_on`, are incompatible with swarm. Swarm expects a list of strings.\n- Deployment labels we\u0027ve discussed and resolved\n- And I\u0027m forced to define volume mapping with functional paths that are platform-specific to my Windows machine, when ultimately they need to be Linux paths. I haven\u0027t looked into this one yet, but I\u0027m sure I can just override the volume mappings in the compose context instead of relying on the `ContainerMountAnnotation`\n- When you look at my samples, some of the hoops I jumped through were because I cannot use a .env file in a stack deploy. (yes, there are tricks to get around this, but if I don\u0027t have to use the `.env`, that\u0027s even better)\n\nMy current workaround involves using a static `docker-compose.deploy.yaml` (essentially an override) to maintain my \"corrections\" to the output file and deploy them together. So my goal is to no longer need that second file.\n\n(I\u0027d like to point out my weird ApplyProductionConfig() extension; I haven\u0027t broken it apart yet.)\n```csharp\nusing

You can treat them like a pipeline written in code (defining steps and tasks etc).\n\nThis looks neat. I\u0027m going to borrow some of the ssh stuff so i can scp my files where i need them to go. \n\nMy original version was an extension of `IResourceBuilder\u003cDockerComposeEnvironmentResource\u003e` because I figured that by the time this executes, the images would have been built, allowing me to use Docker to tag and push them. It looked very similar to your image-pushing code. But after I was done, I realized all I really wanted was to group the push under a task (I know, vanity...), and it was irritating me that the pushing code was coupled to the Docker Compose doc. Then I thought, a project/compute resource should have everything needed to build _and_ push it, never needing to know anything about a compose doc. From there, it was one more leap to realize _why lock in to Docker at all?_ The SDK can build images all on its own without Docker; it just needs _any_ container runtime to execute them. So when I went that route, it solidified the idea that it shouldn\u0027t depend on the compose resource at all.\n\nAssuming the above logic is sound, the next issue is that `aspire publish` builds images but lacks a means to configure the registry. The closest i could find is the `WithImageRegistry` extension that\u0027s only valid on `ContainerResource` which modifies the `ContainerImageAnnotation` but this isn\u0027t available on a `ProjectResource`.\n\nNote: check if I can add `ContainerResourceAnnotation` to a `ProjectResource` and see if Aspire honors it.\n\nThen I got into a whole semantical debate about whether pushing an image to a remote registry (technically any registry besides the local one) is semantically different, justifying the use of `deploy` over a _mere_ publish. Ultimately, I chose the custom deploy step approach because it seemed the easiest way to implement, especially since I couldn\u0027t find another way to tap into the existing publishing workflow (I just wanted to set the registry 😭).\n\nCrisis over, I did the thing, as I\u0027ve described to you. I hope you\u0027re amused; I\u0027m a big fan.\n\n\u003e The other thing I see is the config editing to use secrets instead of using placeholders or environment variables. How does that work in your application code? Using a different IConfiguration source?\n\nYes. I\u0027m using `KeyPerFile`. I think, technically, this might be a bit of an exploit. It just happens to work as is, and now I\u0027m worried you\u0027ll kill it in a future version... It only works because I\u0027m using named secrets. When you add a named secret to a service but only specify the source, it assumes the target is `/run/secrets/${name}`. If I combine that with `KeyPerFile`, the secret file name becomes the secret key. Thus, as long as I make sure the secret name matches the config map convention, it _just_ works. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nAppHost:\n```csharp\n...\n        webClient.PublishAsDockerComposeService((res, service) =\u003e\n        {\n            ...\n            if (builder.Configuration[\"SecretsPath\"] is string secretsPath)\n                service.Environment[\"SecretsPath\"] = secretsPath;\n            ...\n        }\n...\n ```\n\nWebClient:\n```csharp\nif (builder.Configuration[\"SecretsPath\"] is string secretsPath) {\n    builder.Configuration.AddKeyPerFile(secretsPath, optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);\n}\n```\n\n\u003e Overall, I think it would probably be cleaner to support secrets natively (it could be an option).\n\nYes, please. In my current scenario, the .env that\u0027s output is entirely unnecessary; it\u0027s just noise. It would be nice for Aspire not to force environment placeholders where they are not needed.",

But I\u0027m probably missing the point that this is meant to be a project-specific implementation detail and not meant to be reusable or stuffed in a library.\n\nWe\u0027re not 100% fixed on this limitation. In fact, we were just having a discussion about this recently. I can imagine a future where we support multiple callbacks per-resource executed in order of appearance. It might prove nice for resources with complex deployment flows that allow you to break them down into individual pieces.\n\n\u003e Should publishAsDockerCompose have a mechanism to push images? (I think not, since that\u0027s vendor-specific, and can be done via the SDK as I\u0027ve discovered and illustrated above)\n\u003e Should ResourceContainerImageBuilder have a way to push images?\n\nThe proposal is to do this in the `ResourceContainerImageBuilder`. This was implemented in https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/commit/ffb37e0be3efb598aa49c62ab30f747240a9c0b6. It abstracts over the tag/push APIs in Docker/podman/.\n\n\u003e You want to specify the container registry to publish to (https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/9852) cc @captainsafia (there are lots of other issues on this).\n\nYeah, at the moment, we only support modifying the registry that is used when deploying to an Azure compute environment (see https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/5b71632364d874a186d33f1b399cee4ee67e85b9/src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.ContainerRegistry/AzureContainerRegistryExtensions.cs#L74).\n\nWe have the primitives (`ContainerRegistryReferenceAnnotation`, `IContainerRegistry`) to support extending this though.",

For my use case, I\u0027m looking to eliminate this mess: https://github.com/SheepReaper/IHeartFiction/blob/97832dd4778b873cb43b1b8f66f219daa3ff2323/src/aspire/IHFiction.AppHost/Extensions/ResourceBuilderExtensions.cs#L18\n\nBut no matter the angle I approach this, I still don\u0027t have all the tooling support:\n- In the ideal case, I can just set an attribute that specifies the registry, repository, and tag (see note on tag) - `ResourceContainerImageBuilder` does not do this. (I call this hooking into the publishing workflow)\n- If I use a `DeployingCallbackAnnotation`, I have access to a service provider, but `IContainerRuntime` is not public (deploying workflow)\n\nEven if these issues are addressed, multi-arch images are not properly supported. I see in the `DockerContainerRuntime` where `buildx` and `--platform` are used; however, TargetPlatform is always singular, and in my testing, it\u0027s always the build system platform. I may have missed a step, but I successfully generated images using a multi-arch manifest. However, when pushing those images, the foreign arch layers were not pushed. It was the strangest thing. Anyways, using `dotnet publish`, I was able to build and push multi-arch images correctly. I\u0027m scratching my head over the need for a `DockerContainerRuntime` and a `PodmanContainerRuntime`, as the SDK already supports this natively. I hope you can understand my confusion about why it works in .NET CLI but not in Aspire CLI.\n\n**Note on image tag:**\nWhen using `dotnet publish`, the properties I\u0027m using are `ContainerRepository`, `ContainerRegistry`, and `RuntimeIdentifiers` without specifying the tag, and it creates 3 (in my case) images: 1 multi-arch image tagged latest and one single-arch image per runtime (tagged latest-linux-arm64 and latest-linux-x64). Now, I only _need_ the single multi-arch image tagged latest, but I rather like this behavior of multiple images.\n\nAs to the features that I\u0027m looking for, aside from my above ranting:\n- `DockerComposeResource` needs a variety of tweaks to make it generate a swarm-compliant compose file; it might even be enough to justify a `DockerSwarmComposeResource`. Not exhaustive: \n  - Swarm does not support `env_file` - I\u0027d like to support not generating the `.env` altogether and not insisting on template variables when a value is provided (first ones I think of: _IMAGE, _PORT, passwords, and secrets)\n  - I\u0027d like swarm secrets support, please see above for discussion around secrets\n  - The `IResource` already exposes GetReplicaCount() (via ReplicaAnnotation), why doesn\u0027t the Docker Compose generation map the `replicas:` value?\n\nOh, and in the OP, I found a null string; you might want to fix that, too.\n\n",

        "body":  "## Background and Motivation\n\nAspire currently supports parent-child relationships for resources, but the propagation of events and lifecycle state from parent to child is either implicit or tied to relationship type. This can be ambiguous for complex scenarios where developers need fine-grained control over which aspects of behavior are inherited. Explicitly declaring what is inherited (state, events, or both) improves clarity, makes orchestration predictable, and allows for future extension.\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```csharp\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;\n\n[Flags]\npublic enum InheritedBehaviorOptions\n{\n    None = 0,\n    State = 1 \u003c\u003c 0,\n    Events = 1 \u003c\u003c 1,\n    All = State | Events\n}\n\npublic sealed record InheritedBehaviorAnnotation(InheritedBehaviorOptions Options) : IResourceAnnotation\n{\n    public bool InheritState =\u003e (Options \u0026 InheritedBehaviorOptions.State) != 0;\n    public bool InheritEvents =\u003e (Options \u0026 InheritedBehaviorOptions.Events) != 0;\n}\n\npublic static class InheritedBehaviorAnnotationExtensions\n{\n    public static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e WithInheritedBehavior\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, InheritedBehaviorOptions options) where T : IResource\n    {\n        builder.WithAnnotation(new InheritedBehaviorAnnotation(options));\n        return builder;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```csharp\n// Child that inherits both state and events from parent\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"sidecar\", \"image\")\n    .WithParentRelationship(parent)\n    .WithInheritedBehavior(InheritedBehaviorOptions.All);\n\n// Child that only inherits events\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"diagnostics\", \"diag-image\")\n    .WithParentRelationship(parent)\n    .WithInheritedBehavior(InheritedBehaviorOptions.Events);\n\n// Child that inherits nothing\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"independent\", \"indep-image\")\n    .WithParentRelationship(parent)\n    .WithInheritedBehavior(InheritedBehaviorOptions.None);\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\n- Previous model used ParentChildPropagationOptions/ParentChildBehaviorAnnotation with several convenience extension methods. This proposal simplifies the API and uses clearer naming.\n- Could be done with attributes on the relationship itself, but an annotation is more flexible and matches existing Aspire extensibility patterns.\n\n## Risks\n\n- Breaking change for projects using the old API names (ParentChildPropagationOptions, etc.) and extension methods (PropagateAllFromParent, etc.).\n- Requires migration for consumers of removed/renamed methods.\n- Orchestrator logic will need to be updated to recognize the new annotation.",
