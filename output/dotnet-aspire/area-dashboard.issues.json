The \"x\" for each dimension row becomes a \"select all\" for that row, toggling all of the items to be on or off (although the latter would result in no entries, right?).",

It would also be great if you could tail the logs too (too many people don\u0027t know how to find the log tail in Visual studio and it\u0027s useful).\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve mocked it up, and will push a nuget to my Github feed, happy to take suggestions on whether you\u0027d want to take the dashboard in this direction. It\u0027s really hacky right now to get around some limitations on internal classes, but it does the job.\r\n\r\nMy biggest concern with this is that people see it as something they can deploy to prod, and it becomes a security risk, however, if it\u0027s limited to Web, we could force it to not work when the environment is production to help people into that pit of success.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/martinjt/aspire-app-extension\r\n",

For OpenTelemetry, the dashboard is implementing OTLP to collect the traces/metrics/logs. It doesn\u0027t need to be in the same process as the app - in fact running in the app will likely skew the results as it will be tracking its own usage too.\r\n\r\nIf it were reading the data directly from ActivitySource, Meter, \u0026 ILogger, then it would make more sense to be in-proc, but it\u0027s not.\r\n\r\nIt can be easily started as its own process - either running directly or as a container.\r\n\r\nIt could then be questioned as to why use it, rather than jaeger, grafana etc? I think it has a couple of benefits:\r\n- It\u0027s all in one - most OSS tools only deal with one aspect of telemetry\r\n- It has zero configuration, only the port to listen on\r\n- It\u0027s designed for developers rather than ops - this is subtle, but key - it shows what is emitted/collected automatically. Unlike a grafana dashboard, there is no pre-setup required. If a metric is exported, its automatically shown, it doesn\u0027t need to be searched for etc.\r\n- Its light weight - there is no storage for records, no query language. It uses a circular buffer so data is expired when the limits are reached,",

This is a trait I\u0027ve found more prevalent in the .NET ecosystem.\n\nWhile running a docker container isn\u0027t hard, and when you\u0027re in a cloud native world, it\u0027s pretty natural, not all users are comfortable with that.\n\nAllow this to be an extension to an existing site will help normalise using tracing inside monoliths, and even help push people to structured logging.\n\nRight now, the biggest objection I hear for logs over tracing is to do with how easy it is to use locally. Once viewing traces is as easy viewing logs, that barrier becomes a non-issue. So making this a 1 line change inside an existing application will make things easy for non-cloud-native engineers to adopt.\n\nYou can also see from the twitter messages and the chat from the day that there were a lot of asks for it.\n\nI can understand that there are challenges to get the dashboard metrics separated, traces should be easy, logs is probably fine too. However, the question is more about whether this is a useful item, and how useful it is rather than the work involved. In my opinion, and based on public feedback and questions on twitter/mastodon, this is something engineers want.\n\nIf I\u0027m going to use something locally, and spin up containers, I\u0027m going to recommend Jaeger or the otel-desktop-viewer. The lack of a persistent store, and tightly coupling to log sources, and the dashboard view model classes makes it a lot less appealing.\n\nIf I\u0027m using something like Tilt to build a monorepo, then I\u0027m likely to use something more k8s native.\n\nThe niche for this is quick and easy viewing of telemetry in smaller apps, and doing that from a hosted service inside an app is a nice way to do that and increase adoption.",

        "body":  "The .NET Aspire ServiceDefaults project defaults to configuring health check endpoints for service projects. Similarly, .NET Aspire components default to registering health checks for the dependencies they integrate with. Currently, the status of these health checks is not visible anywhere by default. We should consider adding UI to the dashboard (add potentially [concepts to the AppHost app model](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/890)) to display the status of resources\u0027 health checks.\r\n\r\nI can imagine a few click-stops:\r\n\r\n1. Show last known status of health check endpoints, i.e. healthy, degraded, unhealthy, at a glance, perhaps on the relevant resources summary page, e.g. a column with a status indicator icon on the projects page. The interval the health check endpoints are inspected would default to something reasonable (e.g. 10 seconds) and perhaps be configurable either in the dashboard UI and/or in the AppHost app model.\r\n2. Tracking of health check status changes over time, so that in addition to the last status, a history of status requests and their result could be viewed, e.g. clicking on the last known status indicator in the summary would open a view that shows the history of all status checks.\r\n3. A detailed view of all the individual health checks that contribute to the overall status reported for a given health checks endpoint (similar to https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks#HealthCheckUI, perhaps we consider how we might just integrate that given that we\u0027re already depending on the individual health checks from this project from the relevant Aspire component packages)",

        "body":  "Many views of the dashboard display details where it would be beneficial to sort and/or filter by specific values for various columns/fields of data. Today, these views have a top-level \"filter\" UX that is a free-form text field that seems to only actually filter the name column. We should consider standardizing on a UX that allows filtering views by any column based on the current values in the source (one/many/not) or by free-form text (similar to the Excel column filtering UX) or the Application Insights UX). Then the top-level free-form text box search could actually apply across all columns/fields, allowing for simple searching of things like a port number or image name, without having to specifically find that UX in the column-specific filters.\r\n\r\nThis multi-level experience would make it much easier for the user to quickly customize the view of data being presented to better suit various scenarios.",

On Projects it is Name and Source Location. On Containers it is Name and Container Image. On Executables it is Name, Path, Working Directory and Arguments. On StructuredLogs it is just Message and on Traces it is just Name. We actually highlight a couple of fields (e.g. Container ID) via that filter text that we don\u0027t actually filter to (looks like it was an oversight when the fields were added).\r\n\r\n\u003e similar to the Excel column filtering UX\r\n\r\nThe grid has some support for this concept built-in, see e.g. this from the [Typical usage example](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/#typicalusage):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/assets/9613109/72f1fac7-9b90-4dfb-a8d4-9af5565f74df)\r\n\r\nbut it does not, to my knowledge, support any automatic filtering options (e.g. a checkbox list of all options, dropdown of all options, etc like Excel).

        "body":  "In the dashboard we have a few cases where we need to generate CSS directly from C# code. We do this both in .razor files and .razor.cs files and using both ToString() and string interpolation. All of those scenarios by default use the current culture. But in CSS it need to be invariant culture (specifically to prevent commas being used instead of decimal point as seen in #841).\r\n\r\nWe already have CA1305 enabled as a warning for .cs files. \r\n\r\nFirst, we should look at whether this can be enabled for .razor files as well to force us to think about it when using it in .razor files.\r\n\r\nSecond, we should look at what we can do about string interpolation. I don\u0027t think that analyzer does anything for string interpolation (could be wrong) in .cs or .razor files. But this is increasingly what we\u0027re using as opposed to the calls caught by CA1305. So we need some way to ensure we\u0027re consistent about it and avoid similar, hard to track down bugs.",

        "body":  "It would be super useful to be able to change the log level of an app (or all apps) from the dashboard while the apps are running. This would make it very easy to adjust logging level for diagnostics purposes while the app is running while looking at the log output in the dashboard, without needing to find the logging configuration of the app and change it manually, e.g. in the *appsettings.Development.json* file (which is persistent too).\r\n\r\nWhile the JSON config source added by default to read config from *appsettings.json* and *appsettings.[EnvironmentName].json* already responds to file changes in real-time, it would be problematic for a few reasons to have the dashboard try to update this log-level in real-time, e.g. operations on the dashboard shouldn\u0027t have side effects on the source of the apps, how would it work in non-development scenarios when the dashboard is deployed and the apps are running in containers, etc.\r\n\r\n## Strawman proposal\r\n\r\nA new configuration provider could be added by the ServiceDefaults project that activates when an environment variable, e.g. `DOTNET_LOGGER_CONFIG_URL`, is populated with a URL of a remote HTTP endpoint that provides an API surface area for remotely providing logger configuration. The dashboard would set this environment variable when launching the app (similar to the OTLP endpoint).\r\n\r\nThe configuration provided by the service would take precedence over all other default added configuration sources (i.e. be added last), but furthermore, must support overriding the logger specific configuration from the *appsettings.json* files. This is because logger configuration is applied by prefix-based matching, in addition to a specified default, not just config provider ordering, and by default the logger level is set to \"Information\" for all sources in *appsettings.json*, and \"Warning\" for others like \"Microsoft.AspNetCore\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps the app will need to post its current logger config to the service so that the dashboard can return the appropriately combined result, or perhaps the configuration provider added by ServiceDefaults will need to manually adjust the logger filter in addition to updating the configuration provider values.\r\n\r\nIf the endpoint must be protected from unauthorized access, some thought will be required as to how to facilitate this in a way that is durable across dashboard restarts when not run as part of the development scenario, as the lifetime of the apps may differ to that of the dashboard which makes session key style solutions impractical, e.g. a random key generated on dashboard start could not be injected into the already running apps if the apps are not started by the AppHost.",

I don\u0027t remember the exact details, but amongst other things it prioritizes longer keys. For example, let\u0027s say appsettings.json contains a level for \"A.B\" and \"A.B.C.D.E.F\", now the developer changes the level through the dashboard for A.B.C (expecting to change the level for all downstream keys). Just adding a filter rule for \"A.B.C\" will work for all downstream keys _except_ the existing \"A.B.C.D.E.F\", because it is more specific, so it overrules the level from \"A.B.C\".",

Being able to copy and paste a whole configmap file would be really really convenient for creating a helm chart or just some yaml files for my set of services.\n\nI think this could help devs be able to use aspire for local development but also can meet dev and ops teams where they\u0027re at as far as how their apps run in production. Like if they use k8s, boom here\u0027s a config map file, if you use docker compose, boom heres a snippet of how you put environment variables into a compose file, etc...\n@davidfowl ",

In your example the root span appears to be an outgoing request to redis.\n\nI think these examples are from Redis cache initialization that runs in the background of the web app, rather than in response to a request.\n\nThe crux of the request from me here is to use similar formatting for the spans on the Traces page as we do for the spans on the page for a specific Trace. In this case, that means the name shown on the Traces page for the first span would be `webfrontend: DATA redis SET` rather than just `webfrontend: SET` which offers very little detail to understand what the span is about.\n\n\u003e Something not mentioned here, but I thought of from seeing your example, is included uninstrumented outgoing peers in the summary. The traces page would display \"webfrontend\" (source) and \"cache\" (outgoing uninstrumented peer).\n\nYeah I think showing \"synthetic\" spans of some sort for the summary when there\u0027s a call to an uninstrumented outgoing peer would definitely help. Perhaps just including an icon with a tooltip that explains it\u0027s uninstrumented would be enough. As for filtering, a first click-stop could be to just support filtering to uninstrumented peers at all, before allowing filtering to each one.\n",

We can add config to provide control over these, though it\u0027d make it easy for someone to make an insecure system that\u0027s prone to squatting.\r\n\r\nIn your error message, you were hitting both `RemoteCertificateNameMismatch` and `RemoteCertificateChainErrors`. Do you really want to allow disabling both of those?\r\n\r\nNote that we do support specifying [`SslClientAuthenticationOptions`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.sslclientauthenticationoptions?view=net-8.0) via config binding, though it\u0027s not clear to me that it\u0027d be enough for your case. You might be able to set `TargetHost` to work around the `RemoteCertificateNameMismatch`, but the chain error suggests the certificate is not recognised by the trusted CAs on the client machine.",

        "body":  "I am trying to host the aspire dashboard from k8s running on AKS using nginx as an ingress controller and running into some issues. I would essentially like to host the dashboard from:\r\n\r\nhttps://mydomainhere/dev/aspire/dashboard\r\n\r\nUsing aspirate to generate some basic config I have managed to successfully deploy the dashboard out via helm and can access it from the above URL - it however immediately redirects to ```https://mydomainhere/structuredlogs```\r\n\r\nI believe it should be trying to redirect to ```https://mydomainhere/dev/aspire/dashboard/structuredlogs```\r\n\r\nI can put that directly into the browser and it then fails due to it trying to load js/css resources from ```https://mydomainhere/```\r\n\r\nI presume this might be related to it deploying out with a ```\u003cbase href=\"/\"\u003e```\r\n\r\nI tried to see if setting ```ASPNETCORE_URLS``` as mentioned here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/configuration#common-configuration might help but that just leads to an error on startup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHosting failed to start\r\n      System.InvalidOperationException: A path base can only be configured using IApplicationBuilder.UsePathBase()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t think I can \"fix\" this issue via ingress config as I have multiple other web apps running so can\u0027t just, for example, redirect any traffic to ```https://mydomainhere/``` back out to ```https://mydomainhere/dev/aspire/dashboard```\r\n\r\nIs this a scenario that is not currently supported? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",

        "body":  "Hi, Ive been looking into and playing around with the stand alone Aspire Dashboard, and its looking and working great.\r\n\r\nMy only current gripe is that (at least for the structured logs) they are sorted by timestamps ascending. ( oldest first ). this is a bit of a pain point, as I am constantly having to scroll down to the bottom to see the latest logs, as I am mostly interested in the _newest_ logs first (descending order).\r\n\r\nIt doesnt seem like any of the columns are sortable on the structed log data grid, and i would love an option to either add sorting to the columns, or at least have a configurable option to have the default sort be newest first.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

This can be problematic for production scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis feature would help prevent the loss of log files during such reboots. While I don\u0027t expect the Standalone Aspire Dashboard to retain logs indefinitely, a grace period of 30-90 days would suffice for most production scenarios.\r\nThis feature would also prevent data loss when updating the Docker image, since that requires the container to be restarted.\r\n\r\nI wrote to @davidfowl on LinkedIn and [he mentioned that there are currently no short-term plans for long-term storage](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196405765631275008/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7196405765631275008%2C7196413519867588609%29\u0026replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7196405765631275008%2C7196422862423965698%29\u0026dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287196413519867588609%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7196405765631275008%29\u0026dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287196422862423965698%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7196405765631275008%29) ;-)\r\n",

That said, we do not want to build a data storage model optimized for querying logs, metrics and traces. My thought is that we would support a best effort flushing telemetry to disk on graceful shutdown (or on some interval) to handle the survival of reboots/upgrades. This isn\u0027t a scalable persistent store optimized for queries (this is where real APM systems excel). \r\n\r\nTo be clear on the intent here:\r\n- This dashboard should be considered a \"live view\" of telemetry with a fixed buffer size (configurable).\r\n- There\u0027s no plan to build a scalable backend storage or pluggable storage engine for the dashboard.\r\n- If you have a large-scale system sending lots of telemetry to the dashboard likely won\u0027t work very well (large cluster with thousands of services sending telemetry). This is why most large scale APM systems separate collection and analytics.\r\n- This would not be pluggable storage, we write to disk. I\u0027d like to avoid anything complex an extensible. You can mount a volume or copy that data blob if you need it to go elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",

So what if the goal was simply to support deployment of the collector and dashboard as a sidecar or standalone container. Like a modern version of ELMAH. It would help with troubleshooting the new publishing providers and discrepancies between the system in dev and in production. It\u0027s a natural extension of Aspire\u0027s new deployment features without committing to anything beyond the current project scope. \n\nI for one would love to integrate a little admin-only drawer on my site that proxied the dashboard so I can watch user activity in realtime and see how the resources are handling transition to their deployed homes. \n\n📎 It\u0027s possible this is already possible, I just had little luck deploying the \"standalone\" dashboard on AWS (which, \ncommercially, would be a nice place to establish a little beachhead and only fair as they cheekily took the Application Insights name for their own overwrought apm system)\n\n📎 Apologies in advance if ELMAH is already a modern version of ELMAH, just a good example of how a small scale troubleshooting extension provided value in the past.

This will insanely help with testing scenarios of failovers locally - test what happens if you just turn off the database, and than rescale it\r\n\r\nThis would like smth like this:\r\n\r\n![image_2024-06-02_00-06-29](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/assets/46647517/eb97c13b-7225-4277-9883-78e8af90011f)\r\n\r\nThis will also resolve issue https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3095 - as one of the ways to perform \"complete stop\" of the service (or even restart, after some time, with specified replica count we want)\r\n\r\nHowever, It seems easy to add this feature for .NET apps, but it\u0027s might be not so trivial for applications where nodes are required to be in state of consensus (any leader-election, multimaster or master-replica architecture) (for example Kafka or Postgres), because it might be required to add info to all brokers/servers about new added host.",

        "body":  "Hi 👋🏻\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer:** Since my issue is more a feature request than an API change, I decided not to use one of the predefined templates, but I\u0027m happy to provide any further information you need.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m running the Aspire Dashboard as a standalone app via Docker which works nicely 👌🏻 Since multiple Dockerized .NET apps are running on my host, I separated them by making use of the [`PathBaseMiddleware`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.usepathbaseextensions.usepathbase). This way, I can easily reroute them like this:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar app = builder.Build();\r\napp.UsePathBase(\"/myapp\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nApplying this pattern to the Aspire Dashboard would probably mean adding the following code to [`DashboardWebApplication.cs`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/src/Aspire.Dashboard/DashboardWebApplication.cs):\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nif (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(builder.Configuration[DashboardConfigNames.PathBase]))\r\n{\r\n    app.UsePathBase(builder.Configuration[DashboardConfigNames.PathBase]); // maybe sanitize PathBase here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, I could easily reroute the Aspire Dashboard and make it accessible on `https://myhost/aspire-dashboard` instead of using a dedicated port (e.g. `https://myhost:18888/`). A corresponding `docker-compose.yml` could look like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nservices:\r\n  aspire-dashboard:\r\n    image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard\r\n    container_name: aspire-dashboard\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 4317:18889\r\n      - 18888:18888\r\n    environment:\r\n      - Dashboard__PathBase=/aspire-dashboard\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I didn\u0027t do a comprehensive and all-encompassing review of the implications and whether this might break certain features - but at least I want to trigger a discussion 🙂",

This support exists for custom resource services.\r\n\r\nThe following instructions explain the rationale for these tests, as well as the required steps and outcomes along the way.\r\n\r\n## Generate keys\r\n\r\nSome keys and certificates are required for testing. These can be created once and reused across test runs.\r\n\r\nThis script places these files in `C:\\certs\\`. You can use a different path, but must update the path wherever it exists throughout the following example.\r\n\r\nAs you run these commands you\u0027ll be asked for passphrases. Use `root` for the root CA, `client` for the client cert and `server` for the server cert. These values will also be provided in config for the dashboard, further down, so they have to match.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# create root CA details\r\nopenssl genrsa -aes256 -out rootCA.key 4096\r\nopenssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out rootCA.crt -subj \"//CN=MyRootCA\"\r\n\r\n# server\r\nopenssl genrsa -aes256 -out server.key 4096\r\nopenssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj \"//CN=localhost\"\r\nopenssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365 -sha256\r\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out server.pfx -inkey server.key -in server.crt\r\n\r\n# client\r\nopenssl genrsa -aes256 -out client.key 4096\r\nopenssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr -subj \"//CN=localhost\"\r\nopenssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365 -sha256\r\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -out client.pfx -inkey client.key -in client.crt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Modify the app host\r\n\r\nCertificate testing requires a resource service that actually supports certificates, and none exist today (that we have access to). However we can modify the Aspire AppHost model and the `TestShop` playground to demonstrate this working end-to-end.\r\n\r\n1. Clone the `dotnet/aspire` repo down.\r\n1.

The test will break if the number or order of columns changes. I\u0027d like the test to get cells using something other than position. Perhaps we can give each cell a class to look up. Or if that isn\u0027t possible, then embed content in divs with classes. I think it\u0027s ok to make some modest changes to the generated HTML to make testing better.\r\n* If a row\u0027s content doesn\u0027t match the expected content, then the test doesn\u0027t match the row and skips adding it to found rows. But that means the error message just says that the resource wasn\u0027t found. It doesn\u0027t say exactly what didn\u0027t match for the row (e.g. the wrong number of endpoints). Knowing why it didn\u0027t match would be useful.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Please describe the problem.\n\nThe OTel semantic conventions tend to use a single metric to represent variations on operations, and then use dimensions to split the values. For example [gen_ai.client.token.usage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/f79fe6b61438bfa0804df9c254c402fd0d71f42a/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-metrics.md#metric-gen_aiclienttokenusage) is a metric for LLMs to represent the number of tokens used in a LLM call. The same metric is used for both input and output, but has a dimension `gen_ai.token.type` to identify which type it is.\r\n\r\nUsing the same graph line for these two usages is wrong - the values could be orders of magnitude different.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nThere should be an option to split the graph based on a dimension. As part of the dimension list, there should be a checkbox for each dimension as to whether to split the results - drawing independent lines for each value of that dimension.\r\n\r\nThis should probably only be available for a single dimension at a time - doing it for multiple will result in an explosion of lines and it will be hard to follow.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The chart will then always show this resource, if the resource and metric are available. A \"global\" dashpage is one for which all charts specify a resource name.\r\n\r\nToday, the first click on the \"Metrics\" tab in a user\u0027s session produces a largely empty screen. An extra series of actions are required to select a resource in order to see anything:\r\n\r\n\u003cimg src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e8d84f1-36df-46d8-9c35-bddbef419f6b\" alt=\"screenshot of the metrics screen when no resource is selected\" width=\"650\" /\u003e\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of dashpages, we have the opportunity to show metrics whenever the required resources are available.\r\n\r\nEngineering work for this:\r\n\r\n- Add metadata to a dashpage chart for an optional (nullable) resource name.\r\n- Per #5295, we will only show dashpages. Adding global dashpages will require extending those checks to test whether all specified resources are available.\r\n- Update the UI to show navigation items when no resource is selected, but a global dashpage is available.\r\n- Showing a message to the user that they can select a resource to show more options. This could appear below the navigation tree in the current UI.\r\n- Differentiate global dashpages in the navigation tree?\r\n  - Add a group at the top of the navigation tree.\r\n  - Use an icon alongside their name such as 🌐.\r\n",

Please describe the problem.\n\nThe Aspire dashboard provides an https OTLP endpoint for publishing observability data. Since it runs locally with dotnet dev-certs containers with their own isolated network are not able to publish metrics, traces etc. as they do not trust the dev-certs. In addition, dev-certs are only for localhost not host.docker.internal which is used to communicate with the dashboard.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nAspire should help with setting up HTTPS between container and non-container resources. This would allow developers to work with SSL locally in a painless way.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee discussion https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/discussions/5221",

Please describe the problem.\n\nAs an AI engineer developing Generative AI applications locally using VS Code, I aim to instrument and visualize OpenTelemetry (OTEL) signals captured within my app through the Aspire dashboard. Currently, I use the Aspire dashboard to monitor all telemetry signals, particularly to visualize end-user interactions by tracking captured input and output tokens. However, the current version of the Aspire dashboard lacks a user-friendly experience when rendering large text, making analysis difficult. Improving this experience, especially in rendering telemetry signals from AI interactions, would significantly enhance usability and analysis for Gen AI Apps.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a9a368d-1381-4c65-ad5f-4754a3e5bae5)\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nA solution to this problem would be to generate a tree view that organizes all the LLM spans within the same trace or session (correlation ID) and present them in a conversational format. This structure would make it easier to follow the flow of interactions, with each span displayed sequentially alongside its associated metadata, improving clarity and allowing for better analysis of the captured telemetry signals.\n\nBelow are representational sample of user-friendly rendering from market solutions\nArize \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91ca2903-65ce-4d62-bf55-c754fd3a6399)\n\nLangfuse\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/958c0f0d-3caf-4b2a-a346-b865a6e6d55e)\n\nPromtpy Tracing\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/453ae12b-86cc-497c-ad9d-3597a2885be4)\n\n\n\n\n@leslierichardson95  @truptiparkar7\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

URLs are automatically be detected and turned into clickable links, similar to what console logs does.\r\n2. Icons are added for values like state and health status. These would be the same icon displayed on the main resource grid.\r\n3. Turn some fields into URLs. For example, a structured log can belong to a span. The span ID printed in the property grid would link to that UI in the dashboard.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The user can click on show all to see all env vars set on a resource.\n\nLook at it from a users point of view: they didn\u0027t set `PATH` env var on the resource, so it doesn\u0027t show up unless they click \"Show all\". Makes sense. But they didn\u0027t set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` either, Aspire did that so telemetry is sent to the dashboard, yet `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is visible in the list of env vars for some reason.\n\nI think we should only show env vars that a user action - such as adding a reference which that populates service discovery env var. The ASP.NET Core env vars for setting app endpoint URLs probably falls into this category.\n\n\"System\" env vars like OTEL, console logging would be removed from the default view. They could still be viewed by clicking \"Show all\" icon.",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nVisiting the console logs page causes Aspire to load logs. For DCP resources, the host calls DCP get to get its old logs, streaming them from beginning to end, and then continuing to stream new logs as they arrive.\n\nThe problem with this the order doesn\u0027t match what is shown in the Aspire. Aspire wants to shows the latest logs by default, with a scrollbar to go back and view older logs.\n\nBy streaming logs from the beginning, the UI rapidly updates as it quickly tries to render logs from beginning to end, causing the UI to freeze, lock up, and generally behave badly. A resource with 10,000 logs does a lot of UI updates for lines 1-9900 before 9901-10000 are actually displayed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIdeally:\n\n1. The dashboard quickly displays the latest logs.\n2. The dashboard streams new logs as they arrive.\n3. The dashboard loads historical logs in the background.\n\nA couple of solutions I see:\n\n1. The current DCP method to get console logs is tweaked:\n    1. Add a parameter to limit the amount of historical logs returned. The dashboard never attempts to show more than 10,000 logs in the past so this could be passed to provide an upper limit on the amount of data DCP attempts to return.\n    2. The DCP method adds a header with a count of the current number of logs available. This could be used by Aspire to display a loading indicator in logs. The console logs wouldn\u0027t start being displayed until the amount of lines received from DCP equals this line count. This change would stop the UI from trying to display older logs as they\u0027re returned. The downside is there would be a delay while displaying the loading indicator as old logs are loaded.\n\n2. Another option would be for there to be two calls to get log data from DCP:\n    1. One call to stream the last 100 logs, plus new logs. This call would need to return a total log count in the header so the line number is accurate when logs are initially displayed.\n    2. Another call to stream historical logs. It would load old logs in the background.\n    3. NOTE: Aspire host doesn\u0027t use the order that logs are received for ordering, just the date. Theoritically there could be one API call that simulatanously returns logs from newest to oldest while at the same time returning latest logs.\n\nI think option 1 is probably easy both from hosting and DCP perspective. Option 2 would create a better experience by making logs consistently load quickly.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

The following is the set of new options for log requests that can be implemented while keeping these constraints satisfied:\n\n1. `limit=N` this would limit the logs response to N log lines. This option is compatible with `tail` and `since` (see below), but not `follow`.\n2. `tail=N`limits the logs response to (at most) N EXISTING, newest log lines. If `follow` is set, new log lines that appear after the log stream was created do not count against the limit, and will be streamed until the client closes the stream. Not compatible with `since`.\n3. `since=T` limits the logs response to log lines created after timestamp T. \n\nUnfortunately it is not possible for DCP to efficiently determine how many log lines are available for Containers. We could implement that for Executables only if that helps.\n\nI believe the dashboard could implement efficient log retrieval by combining the \"latest log\" stream (`tail=page_size, follow=true`) with retrieving \"previous pages\" of logs on demand (`tail=reverse_page_number*page_size, limit=page_size`). Let me know please if my understanding is correct and if the `since` option makes things easier.\n\n@danegsta @dbreshears FYI",

I apprieticate there are technical limitations, so a real time discussion about what work best would be good.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nI love the addition of `WithLifetime` in the new version of Aspire, but am a bit surprised it\u0027s limited to container-based resources. I would love to use it with other things, e.g. Node/Npm resources. There\u0027s really not much point in having to restart `npm watch` on every Aspire startup for example. I\u0027m also working on a custom resource which would manage locally-run Azurite instance, which would extend `ExecutableResource` and would also benefit from not being restarted every time we stop/start the App Host.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI think adding support for `WithLifetime` to `ExecutableResource` would make a lot of sense.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "With the introduction of `ResourceCommandAnnotation` we\u0027ve added the ability for integration developers to offer up actions that users can initiate via the portal. When a command is executed a short lived \"toast\" notification is displayed to the end user.\n\nI believe that there are further experiences that we may wish to provide via the dashboard to streamline app development which require a more interactive experience. A simple scenario would be prompting for parameter values.\n\nWhen an application launches that requires parameter values, if they are missing then there will be an exception when they are used and the developer will need to stop debugging and then put the parameters in the config file and then re-launch the app host.\n\nInstead of this we could provide two new APIs in the app model - `INotificationService` and `IDialogService` (we can bikeshed the names later). These two interfaces could be used to provide inline experiences in the dashboard.\n\nThe notification service could be used to add a persistent notification in a visible location on the dashboard. The notification would have data model that would allow it to be interacted with. Here is just an example:\n\n```csharp\nvar notification = _notificationService.AddNotification(new {\n  Title = \"Missing parameter\",\n  Description = \"Please provide the missing parameter for ...\",\n  DefaultAction = new NotificationAction(\"Provide value\", async (context, ct) =\u003e {\n      var dialogResult = await _dialogService.OpenDialogAsync(url);\n      \n      if (dialogResult != DialogResult.Cancelled)\n      {\n        await context.Notification.CloseAsync(ct);\n      }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nA few landmarks to point out. Notifications are persistent until they are cancelled (or an optional timeout is specified). Any code with access to the container in the app host could use this service. The dialog service similarly could be called from anywhere but in this context its called from the default action callback on the notification.\n\nIn this case it opens a URL which would become modal on the dashboard and display a webpage which could be offered up either by the app host or a container (allowing for some slick UX scenarios for integrations).",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWhen opening the dashboard, resources are automatically grouped and sorted by Type and Name. This is fine when working with 3-4 resources, however, when the list includes 10+ resources it would be great if the most important resources could be at the top or somehow easy to find, so one could easily find and click the endpoint URL to open the web sites.\n\nFor instance, I\u0027m working with solutions that include two frontend apps, a backend, several agents, and a few storage services running locally via docker. The frontend apps are of type \"Project\", so even adding a prefix to hack the alphabetic order they are listed after the container apps. \n\nTangentially related: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/896\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n## Option 1\n\nAllow to define the position of each resource, something like\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cMyApp\u003e(\"foo\").WithDashboardPosition(0);\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"bar\", \"image\").WithDashboardPosition(5);\n```\n\nand a way to define how columns are sorted, with a new \"Position\" column (potentially hidden)\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.Configuration[\"DashboardDefaultSorting\"] = \"byPosition,byType,byName\";\n```\n\n## Option 2\n\nAllow to attach an icon to each resource, possibly a clickable icon. I could use this to add a \"web\" icon to the app to open, and could simply click the icon to open the associated endpoint.\n\n```csharp\n// not clickable\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"bar\", \"image\").WithDashboardIcon(icon: \"some-icon.png\", url: null);\n\n// click defaults to endpoint URL\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"bar\", \"image\").WithDashboardIcon(icon: \"some-icon.png\");\n\n// custom URL - the user can inject the endpoint manually as a query param if they need to\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cMyApp\u003e(\"foo\").WithDashboardIcon(icon: \"some-icon.png\", url: \"https://go.here.first?thenTo=...\");\n```",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWhilst Aspire does show console output from docker, this does not include showing the progres of image downloads.  A larger image could take several minutes (particularly over a slow network connection).  From the aspire dashboard, it\u0027s indistinguishable as to whether the container start has gotten stuck, or if progress is being made on the download\n\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nWhen pulling fromt eh command line, the docker UI shows a progress bar.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nThis is related to problem https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/4131. I am setting up our distributed solution with two launch profiles - one running projects on the developer machine, and one running everything as containers (as we host our end product on kubernetes). In either solution we are generating our own certificates for https and trusting them in containers to facilitate secure communication. \n\nHowever the aspire dashboard and related endpoints uses the dev cert and only the dev cert with no apparent way to override. This means that our containers are unable to communicate via https to aspire endpoints, and we are forced to set unsecured communication for features like OLTP.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nTLDR; Request the ability to set the certificate for https bindings for aspire dashboard and related endpoints like we can any other kestrel hosted web application.\n\nBecause of the above issue with dashboard via a project using the dev certificate, we are currently running on http for OLTP exporting to the dashboard. We would prefer to go over https, and see two possibilities to solve this:\n\n1. (Preferred and the point of this ticket) - it would be great to specify the ssl certificate for the aspire dashboard like you can for most other kestrel applications. I tried setting the Kestrel configuration block in app settings but it was ignored. I inspected the entire aspire dashboard configuration and did not see anything obvious to override. \n2. (less ideal but we may be pursuing until we can specify the cert for aspire dashboard) the dev cert generated seems to be always called CN=localhost - we can pull this cert and add it to container as well as our generated certs we are already using, so our core apps can trust the certificate. I suspect however this will most likely fail anyways as the cert only has localhost as cn or subject alternative name, and would not include the docker internal host. \n\nSo even though we have considered these two approaches, really only 1 seems viable. Being able to BYO certificate for the dashboard would allow a safe solution the OLTP https issue and any other communication issues between aspire endpoints and containers.\n\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

In this case my breakpoint will be hit with many irrelevant cases.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIt would be handy to be able to detach and reattach the debugger from the dashboard. This can be done manually in visual studio but having it in the dashboard would be convenient. Also there could be the possibility to detach / reattach the debugger from all the projects with a single action in the dashboard\n",

That space could be better utilized **to reduce clicks**. For example, if I could hide the \"Type\" column and allocate that width to the \"Actions\" column, it would save me several clicks since I frequently use \"Restart\" during development, and Restart is always hidden behind the \"...\" menu.\n\n### Additional context\n\nBy the way, are they officially called \"Actions\" or \"Resource Commands\"? (ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/custom-resource-commands) Both work, but aligning on a single term could simplify documentation and discussions.",

This is happening across several app hosts.\n\nFirst time I run my app, the dashboard is fine, but subsequent times, restarting my app host in visual studio usually results in the dashboard loading with an error state, although occasionally it will load fine first time.  After a refresh the dashboard loads fine\n\nI do notice when this happens, the browser window is opened long before the `Login to the dashboard at https://localhost:17079/login?t=WHATEVER` log is logged, combine this with a refresh fixing things makes me suspect it\u0027s an issue with the dashboard browser window being opened a little prematurely.\n\nI also don\u0027t recall having this with earlier versions of preview 1, but I have since upgraded to VS 17.13.0, so perhaps it\u0027s a VS issue rather than aspire?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc03bbce-2d46-4fe1-805c-f08fe36923fb)\n\nOccasionally however the dashboard will totally fail to load on a restart with a connection refused\nWhen this happens, I get a `System.IO.IOException: Failed to bind to address https://127.0.0.1:17079: address already in use.` in my app host console (with `\"https://localhost:17079;http://localhost:15214\"` being hte `applciationUrl` in `launchsettings.json`.  This one I suspect happens if the new Dashboard tries to start up before the old Dashboard instance has fully shut down.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6013660-ba15-4c70-8e7c-e8f020fc935c)\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe dashboard should load\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nTake any aspire app host\n1. Start without debugging\n2.

Whilst academically I know the health check ought to be re-running,   Having some kind of evidence in the UI that the health check has run would help settle that lingering doubt.\n\nSome context for why I originally field this issue - my HTTP healthcheck was rendering perfectly fine when I hit it in my browser, but timed out from Aspire.  Given that it was working fine in the browser, the one explanation I could not get out of my head was that the Aspire health check was not re-running - having some evidence that healthchecks were actually runnign would have helped me avoid going down some rabbit holes.  It eventually turned out the problem was that the healthcheck endpoint was restricting it\u0027s port via `RequireHost` rather than `HttpContext.Connection.LocalPort` which explained why the health check worked fine in the browser, but not from Aspire (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-9.0#host-matching-in-routes-with-requirehost).

Asipre has been great so far but we still get daily hicups which forces us to destroy and recreate the codespace, sometimes multiple times per day.\n\nI\u0027ll create a separate issue for the problems we\u0027re getting. This one happens sometimes when stopping and relaunching the project.\n\nAll the service seem to show up on the call stack but the dashboard errors up with this error:\n\n```shell\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpproc.monitor.os-executor[0]\n      could not stop root process\t{\"root\": 10637, \"error\": \"process 10637 not found: process start time mismatch, pid might have been reused: pid 10637, expected start time 2025-03-22T01:32:25.277Z, actual start time 2025-03-22T01:32:31.290Z\"}\n```\n\nIf I try to access the dashboard it will not load both from the localhost and the special codespace link that was added in aspire 9.1.\n\nThe services actually load up correctly and start up. The problem seems to be specifically on the dashboard.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5863ce6c-e419-4568-a7ea-bd1b76550a3d)\n\nAlso in the ports section I see that the dashboard does not have a running process asociated with it\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68434599-0a66-4ca1-9d82-f9fe3e06141f)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAspire to launch consistently without errors for long periods (A full day) of using the codespace.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nThis might be a hard one to reproduce as it does not happen immediately. It happens daily but randomly during the day to different developers while stopping and starting aspire regularly during development and debugging.\n\nIf any information I can provide or collaboration so that you can identify the issue I\u0027m 100% willing to help.\n\nHere is the devcontainer.json we\u0027re using\n\n```json\n// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json.

Please describe the problem.\n\nIt would be useful for me to be able to filter traces and sort by duration on the \u0027Traces\u0027 tab, so that when I am load testing services locally (and using the Aspire dashboard to monitor them), I can easily see excessively long (or short) trace durations. At the moment it\u0027s a case of scrolling through the list looking for the fullest duration \u0027circle\u0027 visualisation which is pain-staking.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nBeing able to filter for specific duration ranges (less-than, greater-than or both together) or/and sort them in either direction would be really helpful.\n\nIn general an expansion of dashboard capabilities would be great (e.g. sort on and filter on all columns on all tabs), but this would be a good start from my point-of-view.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"863\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05dcd035-b635-42ec-b891-f58c387a8590\" /\u003e\n\n### Additional context\n\n@adamint FYI (as requested)",

        "body":  "In 9.2 we added resource icons to the resources table and graph views. We should go further and enable resources to specify their own custom icons to be used when displayed in the dashboard. This should be done in such a way that hosting integrations can specify custom icons for their resources, so that, e.g., the Redis resource could show up with the Redis icon in the dashboard.\n\nThe icon itself would need to be sent from the app host resource server to the dashboard process so would need to be serializable. I imagine we\u0027d want to support SVG which has the advantage of being vector and text-based. We could support bitmap-based formats like PNG, ICO, JPG, etc., by encoding them as data-uris.\n\nI imagine an API kinda like the following for using a file on disk:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"foo\", \"foo\")\n    .WithResourceIcon(\"./myicon.svg\");\n```\n\nAnd perhaps something like this for something embedded, e.g. in a hosting integration:\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"foo\", \"foo\")\n    .WithResourceIcon(EncodeAsDataUri(Resources.MyIcon), ImageFormat.Png);\n```",

If so, how?\n- Should URLs be hyperlinks on the graph view?\n- Should URL display text be shown on the graph view? Or associated endpoint name?\n- Should you be able to control **which** URL(s) are shown on the graph view, separately to the resources table and resource details grid?\n- Should you be able to have a URL visible on the resources table but **not** in the resource details grid?

Please describe the problem.\n\n### Scenario\n1. Run Aspire application from Visual Studio or VS Code.\n2. Switch to VS, right-click on one of the projects that belong to the running application, choose \"Rebuild\"\n3. Observe Aspire dashboard\n\n### Expected\nThe dashboard should indicate that the project is not running when it is being rebuild\n- Resource state should be different from \"Running\"\n- Process ID should disappear (the old process ID is no longer valid)\n- The project should be considered \"unhealthy\"\n\n### Actual\nWhen the project is being rebuilt, there is no change to the project state in Aspire dashboard. This includes the case if the rebuild fails, which may take developer a long time to remedy.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI propose we introduce a new state for projects/Executables: Suspended\n\n1. When rebuild starts, the Executable goes into Suspended state. There is new notification type for this that the IDE sends to DCP, which in turn notifies the Aspire dashboard.\n2. The IDE needs to send a Suspended notification for all active debug sessions that are affected by project rebuild.\n3. In Suspended state \n    a. The project/Executable is not running. Process ID is no longer available.\n    b. The project is considered unhealthy.\n    b. Dashboard can still request logs, but stop/restart gestures should be disabled.\n4. From Suspended state the Executable can only transition to Exited state, or Running state (upon receiving Session Terminated, or Process Restarted notifications, respectively).\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe work required here spans DCP, IDE execution protocol, VS/VS Code/other IDEs that might support this scenario, Aspire dashboard and Aspire resource health.\n\n@LittleLittleCloud @danegsta @JakeRadMSFT @JamesNK @adamint @rafaelldi FYI",

Please describe the problem.\n\nPersistent containers are great for speeding up dependencies in consecutive runs of an AppHost.   However if you finish using an application and move to work on a different application, they\u0027ll continue to hang around until you shut down docker completely.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIt would be nice to have a way to tell aspire to shut down all containers (**including** persistent ones).  A few ideas for how this could be done\n\n- A toggle in the aspire UI which when enabled will cause aspire to stop all containers on shut down.\n- An \"Exit\" button in the dashboard UI, which can also include an option to shut down all resources.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I can see some values in local storage, I assume it\u0027s meant to pick up one of these to restore the filter?\n\nSame result in both Chrome and Edge\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74fb76d4-49c4-47f8-a660-f16db0ce2057)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFilter settings to restore when stopping/starting debugging.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nFire up the project in Visual Studio 2022, run with F5, dashboard loads, filter to \u0027Project\u0027 only. Stop debugging, start again, filter is reset.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.300\n Commit:            15606fe0a8\n Workload version:  9.0.300-manifests.af4147de\n MSBuild version:   17.14.5+edd3bbf37\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.300\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [wasm-tools]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36119.2, VS 17.14.36119.2\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.5/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current\\9.0.5\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36119.2, VS 17.14.36119.2\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.51/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\9.0.51\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [aspire]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36119.2, VS 17.14.36119.2\n   Manifest Version:    8.2.2/8.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\8.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.aspire\\8.2.2\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maccatalyst]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36119.2, VS 17.14.36119.2\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.9288/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst\\18.4.9288\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [ios]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36119.2, VS 17.14.36119.2\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.9288/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.ios\\18.4.9288\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [wasm-tools-net6]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36119.2\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.5/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.net6\\9.0.5\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [android]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36119.2, VS 17.14.36119.2\n   Manifest Version:    35.0.61/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.android\\35.0.61\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.5\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       e36e4d1a8f\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.409 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.204 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.36 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.15 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\n### Anything else?\n\nVS 2022 Preview 17.14.1 Preview 1\n\nMicrosoft Edge for Business\nVersion 136.0.3240.76 (Official build) (64-bit)\n\nChrome Version 136.0.7103.114 (Official Build) (64-bit)",

This points to a larger issue around localStorage vs sessionStorage properties since new runs from an IDE will launch a new browser tab with a new session. So even though the proper place for these specific settings *is* in session storage, IDE users will still experience the \u0027wrong\u0027 behavior.\n\nLooking through browser launch target APIs, there\u0027s no way to attach an opener to the opened browser Window in order to preserve prior session storage. So maybe the right move is to:\n- whenever writing to sessionStorage, also write to localStorage with `IDE` prepended. ie, `Resources_PageState` (sessionStorage) -\u003e `IDE_Resources_PageState` (localStorage)\n- pass through the launch environment (ide or no) to dashboard\n- when retrieving an object from session storage, if launched from IDE fallback to looking in localStorage with the prepended key  \n\nI think this solves our problem more generally since users will see similar behavior in all pages, even though we\u0027ve only gotten reports for this page.\n\n@JamesNK thoughts?\n\nedit: I\u0027m realizing now that if the AppHost+dashboard were made persistent, the user wouldn\u0027t have to restart their debug session and so a new session would never be needed.

Please describe the problem.\n\nWhen running aspire, I usually want to investigate the traces of a resource. Some of the resources have health checks that will run periodically and ping their dependencies. This results in bloating the traces view with traces I\u0027m not particularly interested in. So I have then to carefully search for the traces I\u0027m interested in, filter out the ones that are irrelevant, or pause the traces (great feature btw.).\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIt would be great to have the possibility (maybe even as default?) to aggregate the traces by Http Route (template)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1b6fe29-bd43-4d27-913b-45ccbfa0a680)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Open Visual studio.\n2. Open a aspire project and run it.\n3. A new window will open in the chromium edge, TAB to \"Resources\" tab item and hit ENTER key.\n4. Verify that Keyboard focus does not return to the parent control after closing the Help, Github copilot and settings dialog.\n\n### Actual Result:\nKeyboard focus does not return to the parent control after closing the Help, Github copilot and settings dialog.\n\n### Expected Result:\nAfter closing the Help, Github copilot and settings dialog, the keyboard focus should return to the parent control that had focus before the dialog was opened.\n\n### User Impact:\nThe keyboard focus does not return to the parent control after closing the dialog, making it difficult for keyboard users to continue navigating the application and this issue causes confusion as the screen reader leaving users uncertain about their current position within the application. As a result, users may need to spend additional time and effort to manually navigate back to the desired control, which can be particularly challenging for those relying solely on auditory feedback.\n\nAttachment:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3bf1020-49b8-467b-b318-baf0768172d1",

Please describe the problem.**\nWe would like to add support for representing progress as a first class state for resources. Currently, there is no clear way to indicate that a resource is undergoing some operation when the duration or completion percentage is unknown, or when partial progress is known (e.g., a file download).\n\n*Today, two resources implement progress status updates as human-readable text:*\n\n1. **Ollama in the community toolkit** ([OllamaUtilities.cs](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Aspire/blob/1df114f181f83540e0e50cfb1b12c82d1ab7d034/src/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Ollama/OllamaUtilities.cs))\n2. **AI Foundry Local** ([AzureAIFoundryExtensions.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/e026c5d5dc631a1213e644582d6e466f75ec45c6/src/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry/AzureAIFoundryExtensions.cs))\n\nBoth resources update the status by publishing notification strings like `\"Downloading {model} {percentage}%\"`, rather than using a structured progress field. This is a workaround due to the absence of first-class progress/percentage support in the resource state model.\n\n**Describe the solution you\u0027d like**\nAdd new states to resources that support both indeterminate progress (something is happening but we don\u0027t know how long it will take) and percentage-based progress (we know the current percent complete, e.g., model or file download). This would help consumers of the resource understand that work is in progress and, when possible, see how much is left to complete.\n\n**Additional context**\nThis issue is to track the discussion and implementation of these new resource states (indeterminate and percentage-based progress).\n",

        "body":  "When documenting the interaction service, I noticed that the message bar intent styles could be improved. Right now, there\u0027s little distinction between:\n\n- Information and Confirmation (I think one just adds buttons)\n- Error and Warning (only seem to differ by icon)\n\nThe colors for the dark theme aren\u0027t really fun to look at either.\n\n#### Light theme\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1810\" height=\"781\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9af9b9-62c1-426b-84de-24f29733b330\" /\u003e\n\n#### Dark theme\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1810\" height=\"781\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8c33e9c-5a5b-4fcf-b375-dac10619b3da\" /\u003e\n\n#### Possible considerations\n\nMaybe the confirmation message bar could use some of the Aspire purple colors? The warning could be more orange, and maybe a blue for the information intent? There was also peer feedback about the action buttons feeling a bit distant from the words when there\u0027s fewer words—but personally, I think those are fine since they\u0027re next to the dismissal \"X\" button. But more contrast on those might help a bit.\n\n#### API naming considerations\n\nOne final, somewhat related thought: when the team was talking about this UX element, we naturally referred to it as \"notification bar\", however; the API calls it a \"message bar\" which seems like a potential opportunity to improve that API name to more closely align with its use. When I first saw this API, I assumed \"message bar\" was like a \"status bar\" or something, near the footer. Then I saw what it did in the UI, and thought, \"oh, that\u0027s a notification.\"",

It is using the message bar control and buttons are placed to the right on the message bar. And all the buttons I\u0027ve send in message bars are always on the right, e.g. Visual Studio, GitHub.\n\n\u003e and maybe a blue for the information intent?\n\nI think blue might look better than the grey/black we have today.

Please describe the problem.\n\nIn the Aspire dashboard, the Table View allows collapsing child resources under an application (e.g., db-migration, postgresdb). This improves clarity and navigation, especially in larger solutions. However, this functionality is missing in the Graph View. All resources are shown at once, which can lead to visual clutter.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI’d like the Graph View to support collapsing and expanding child resources, just like the Table View does. Ideally, there would be a toggle or button to show/hide dependencies or child services under a particular node. This would make the graph more manageable and readable in complex applications.\n\nAn alternative could be an automatic grouping or a filter that lets users hide specific types of nodes (e.g., databases, background jobs, etc.).\n\n### Additional context\n\n**Table View with collapse functionality:**\n\n\u003cimg width=\"2227\" height=\"810\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b67033d-5fc2-4493-bb65-95db14ec0448\" /\u003e\n\n**Graph View without collapse functionality:**\n\n\u003cimg width=\"2227\" height=\"810\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad691a6-5783-4334-9971-e0fbbcc5f91f\" /\u003e\n\n\nThis feature would be especially helpful when working with microservices or multiple infrastructure dependencies, where the visual graph can grow very quickly.",

Expanding resources**  \n- A simple toggle on the node (e.g. a chevron icon) could expand/collapse.  \n- Double-clicking the node could be another quick way to expand.  \n- Expansion would ideally only redraw the local area, not the entire graph.\n\n**2. Indicating collapsed children**  \n- A collapsed node could show a small badge like “+3” to indicate hidden children.  \n- A subtle icon (chevron, plus/minus) would make it clear the node is expandable.  \n- Tooltip/hover could list the children without expanding.\n\n**3. Relationships when collapsed**  \n- Instead of drawing all child edges, collapsed nodes could show an aggregated edge to external nodes.  \n- This edge might be styled differently (lighter or dashed) with a count of hidden connections.  \n- On expand, the individual edges would be restored.\n\n---\n\nI agree that implementing this fully would add some complexity, but even a lightweight version (e.g. grouping with a toggle and aggregated edges) might help a lot when working with larger resource graphs. It could be an incremental improvement rather than an all-or-nothing feature.",

However, it can be difficult to get a quick **high-level overview** of how a specific request propagated through the system — especially when trying to understand which resources interacted with each other and in what sequence.\n\nIn large, distributed systems, it\u0027s important to quickly grasp the \"big picture\": which resources were involved in a trace, how they were connected, and the overall flow without digging into low-level spans. This makes it easier to debug inter-resource issues and communicate the system’s behavior visually — for example, when creating tickets or discussing bugs/features with other developers or product owners.\nThis is especially true when trying to explain complex interactions to team members who may not be familiar with the detailed performance metrics but need to understand the request flow.\nThis is a common challenge when working with distributed systems, where understanding the sequence of resource interactions is crucial for debugging and system design discussions.\nThis is not just about performance, but about understanding the **structure and timing** of resource interactions\n— a request-centric view of how components interacted, rather than a detailed performance breakdown.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI’d like to propose a **high-level graph view** focused on a single trace, showing how resources interacted over time. The goal is **not** to replace the Flame Graph, but to provide a simpler top-level visualization. This view would:\n\n- Represent resources as nodes in a graph.\n- Show directional edges based on which resource called which, in the order of the trace timeline.\n- Only include high-level interactions (e.g. `ResourceA → ResourceB → ResourceC \u0026 ResourceD`).\n- Optionally show timestamps or relative timing to illustrate when each call occurred.\n- Allow users to switch into the Flame Graph for deeper investigation if desired.\n- Be optimized for readability and screenshots to help with debugging sessions, documentation, or ticket creation.\n\nThis would serve as a top-level summary of trace flow, making it easier to explain and reason about request behavior across resources.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis feature could greatly enhance team collaboration by providing a shared, intuitive visualization of service interactions. It would simplify error analysis and communication about complex flows, focusing on the most relevant connections and their timing. Since the necessary trace data is already available, integration with existing dashboards should be straightforward. A clear, simplified graph would also support onboarding new team members and documenting system behavior effectively.",

Each node in the graph would correspond to a resource (e.g., API, database, cache, microservice), and edges would indicate the communication paths, annotated with timing information. The sum of the timings for each edge would represent the total time taken for that interaction, providing insights into performance and potential bottlenecks.\nThis graph would not focus on individual requests or responses but rather on the overall communication patterns and timings between resources. It would help in understanding how different components of the system interact, the latency involved in each interaction, and where optimizations can be made.\n\nThe following example illustrates how a trace could be represented as a resource communication graph:\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1500\" height=\"350\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67b12ab8-2525-4fdc-9850-d0b9bfe430cc\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1500\" height=\"350\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b9c2529-f368-4808-a880-459b672e8a63\" /\u003e\n\nThe timing information would be the sum of all interactions of the previous node in the graph, regardless of the number of requests to or responses from that node. This means that if the API made multiple calls to the database, the total time for that interaction would be aggregated into the edge connecting the API and the database nodes.\n    The graph would also include the total time taken for the entire trace, which would be the sum of the timings for all edges in the graph. For example, if the total time for the trace was 3.38 seconds, this would be indicated at the start node (S) of the graph.\n\n In a more complex scenario, the graph would include multiple nodes and edges, representing various resources and their interactions.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1500\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9e4612d-d888-4bf8-8d7d-c86c075e2f4e\" /\u003e\n\nThe resource communication graph would be particularly useful for visualizing complex interactions in microservices architectures, where multiple services, databases, and caches are involved. It would allow developers and system architects to see the big picture of how resources communicate, making it easier to identify inefficiencies or areas for improvement.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nThis is more of a QoL improvement than a problem. I think it would be good to have a button to toggle on/off the visibility of all environment variables on the dashboard.\n\nSome resources can have upwards of 20 environment variables injected, and it\u0027s useful to see what the values are on the dashboard quickly, but today we have to go one by one and toggle on every variable individually, and there is no multiselect. So, a button to toggle on all variables would be good I think.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI think a button (the same button we use for the individual variables) next to where it shows the number of variables, 16 in this picture, to make all variables visible, could be useful.\n\n\u003cimg width=\"918\" height=\"242\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f399d30-2f5d-4e61-b813-1feb10c09e9b\" /\u003e\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Clean machine: Win11 x64 24h2 ENU\n2. Install SDK 9.0.303 and Aspire 9.4.0\n3. Execute `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` to trust the dev cert of SDK 9.0.303\n4. Create an Aspire Starter App and run the project. It runs successfully.\n5. Install SDK 10.0 P7, and do not execute `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`\n6. Open the project created in step 4 and run it using `dotnet run`, and open URL in the browser.\n\n**NOTE**:\n1. This issue only occurs on the first run.\n2. If you open a project that was run before the 9.0.303 dev cert was established, or a project that has not been run since the dev cert was established, the issue will not be reproduced.\n3. After adding the 10.0 P7 dev cert, open the existing 9.0 project to run it, and this issue will not repro.\n\n**ACTUAL**\nThe page is blank.\n\u003cimg width=\"1715\" height=\"935\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60f49ccc-7c2b-4f00-a53f-6dee65702041\" /\u003e\n\nAfter refreshing, I encountered this error.\n\u003cimg width=\"1715\" height=\"936\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55dca965-bfde-43a3-bb30-f8c19d812f04\" /\u003e\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dashboard.Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Server.Circuits.CircuitHost[111]\n     Unhandled exception in circuit \u0027Rhys8rR4C__-yQ1Cg3X_myEcKJ6F5XR38_oj6SsuJjc\u0027.\n    Microsoft.JSInterop.JSException: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://localhost:17111/_content/Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components/Components/Anchor/FluentAnchor.razor.js?v=4.11.9.25128\nTypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://localhost:17111/_content/Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components/Components/Anchor/FluentAnchor.razor.js?v=4.11.9.25128\n        at Microsoft.JSInterop.JSRuntime.InvokeAsync[TValue](Int64 targetInstanceId, String identifier, Object[] args)\n        at Microsoft.FluentUI.AspNetCore.Components.FluentAnchor.OnAfterRenderAsync(Boolean firstRender) in /_/src/Core/Components/Anchor/FluentAnchor.razor.cs:line 133\n        at Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderTree.Renderer.GetErrorHandledTask(Task taskToHandle, ComponentState owningComponentState)\n\nStop running, then run again, the page can be displayed normally.\n\u003cimg width=\"1703\" height=\"930\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d392db3-1aad-4f93-b43b-7c60c93af559\" /\u003e\n\n**EXPECTED**\nThe project can be run successfully without any errors.",

This only happens if the traces bigger and with a lot spans and nesting. \n\nI looked in the code and I think the problem lies in the fact that the FluentDataGrid component that src/Aspire.Dashboard/Components/Pages/Traces.razor is using is set to be virtualized. I think this is not supported when you have items of different sizes as children (since you can collapse and uncollapse spans - which makes it hard for virtualization to know the size of a child )\nNot sure if not setting virtualize as true could maybe be a better experience than this.\n\nFor me this makes the traces view not usable in those scenarios.\nA button for collapsing and uncollapsing all children would maybe be a workaround.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWhen running a DotNet Aspire application, the Aspire dashboard currently displays *parameters* alongside *active resources* in the Resources pane. While parameters are technically part of the configuration, they tend to be static and rarely change during runtime. Including them in the same view as dynamic resources creates unnecessary visual clutter and makes it harder to focus on the components that are actively running or interacting.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIntroduce a tabbed interface (or similar UI separation) within the Resources pane:\n- **Running Resources Tab**: Displays services, containers, and other runtime components.\n- **Parameters Tab**: Displays static configuration values and environment parameters.\n\nThis separation would improve clarity, reduce cognitive load, and make the dashboard more intuitive—especially for users monitoring live systems or debugging resource behavior.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Cleaner UI with better focus on runtime elements\n- Easier navigation and inspection of relevant components\n- Improved developer experience during debugging and monitoring\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

The code block to have a horizontal scroll bar, and the contents to not overflow the right hand side of the message box\n2. On a large 4k screen, it seems rather silly to have horizontal scroll whilst the message box is limited to only ~450px width.  It would be nice if the message box could grow in width for this.  (Although at some point, a scroll bar will still be necessary)\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n```cs\nbuilder.Eventing.Subscribe\u003cBeforeStartEvent\u003e(async (evt, ct) =\u003e\n{\n   var interactionService = evt.Services.GetRequiredService\u003cIInteractionService\u003e();\n\n   _ = Task.Run(async () =\u003e\n   {\n      if (!interactionService.IsAvailable)\n      {\n         return;\n      }\n\n      await interactionService.PromptMessageBoxAsync(\n         title: \"Installation Failed\",\n         message: $\"\"\"\n            Failed to to install:\n            ```\n            {Environment.StackTrace}\n            Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Really Long message \n            ```            \n            \"\"\",\n         options: new MessageBoxInteractionOptions\n         {\n            EnableMessageMarkdown = true,\n            Intent = MessageIntent.Error,\n         });\n   });\n});\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

It never got approved because of the limits, and improving it would have been a lot of work and no one had asked for file support yet. I ended up closing it. The branch is still available [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/compare/main...jamesnk/file-input).\n\n@gabriel-systems What do you want to use this for? How big are your files? You talked about selecting folders. How many files do you want to add at once?\n\n@davidfowl How big does the file support need to be? 5mb? 50mb? 500? 5000? The bigger it is, the more work will be required to support it? i.e. sending it across gRPC in one chunk or many, keeping it in memory or saving to temporary disk location, etc.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nIt\u0027s common in wizard UIs to want a dropdown\u0027s options to be dependent on what was previously selected.\n\nFor example, choosing an option in `Select your country` updates `Select your city`.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n1. A callback to provide a dropdown\u0027s option. Callback will also specify whether the dropdown is enabled (e.g. `Select your city` is disabled until `Select your country` has a value.\n2. Some configuration that specifies what inputs the select is dependent on. The callback is executed when those inputs change\n3.
