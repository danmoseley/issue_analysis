A scenario that I\u0027ve been playing with is creating a reusable component that allows you to easily receiver webhook notifications from GitHub and forward them to an Azure Storage queue. The container with the actual application logic would be hosted in Docker Hub, and there would be a NuGet package containing extension methods for wiring it up. This is what the usage would look like in a consuming application.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\nvar secret = builder.AddSecretStore(\"mysecrets\").AddSecret(\"webhooksharedsecret\");\r\nvar queues = builder.AddAzureStorage(\"azstorage\").AddQueue(\"azqueues\");\r\nvar webhookReceiver = builder.AddGitHubWebhookReceiver(\"webhookreceiver\", secret, queues);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the developer building this extension they want to be able to just have an Aspire host that they can run in their own repo that allows them to spin up their web app. Having an API like `AddProjectContainer\u003cT\u003e(...)` would allow for this scenario:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e AddGitHubWebhookReceiver(this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder, string name, IResourceBuilder\u003cSecretResource\u003e secret, IResourceBuilder\u003cAzureQueueStorageResource\u003e queues)\r\n{\r\n  #if DEBUG\r\n    return AddProjectContainer(...);\r\n  #endif\r\n\r\n   #if !DEBUG\r\n    return AddContainer(...);\r\n   #endif\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt allows the return type to always be a container, even though in the home repo for the Aspire extension you can build from project sources and attach debuggers etc. AddProjectContainer(...) might rely on something with launch profiles to make this work as you\u0027ve suggested though.",

We would need to some kind of standardized mechanism so components can opt into this behavior (e.g. IResourceSupportsContainer ... terrible name but you get the point).\r\n\r\nThere is also a question of what happens to the resource that is in the app model already. Does AsContainerInLocalDev remove it from the app model and replace it with the container resource.\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you end up with code like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar postgres = builder.AddPostgres(\"catalogdb\");\r\nvar app = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.Frontend\u003e(...)\r\n    .WithReference(postgres);\r\npostgres.AsContainerInLocalDev(container =\u003e container\r\n        .WithDataVolume()\r\n        .WithInitDb(\"../data/scripts/catalogdb\")\r\n        .WithEnvironment(\"POSTGRES_DB\", \"AppDb\")\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would probably break a bunch of callbacks. I think what we\u0027d probably end up having to do here is have a shim resource type like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class PostgresContainerResource(PostgresServerResource innerResource) : ContainerResource(innerResource.Name)\r\n{\r\n   // Redirect Annotations to inner resource.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way all the APIs you want for container like things are there, but you are really just leveraging the fact that its the annotations that really drive all the behavior.",

For container running in docker and specially linux based has this feature and docker allow to restrict memory and cpu for that. \r\n\r\nNow many of the times investigation required in context of production environment, for example production environment running one kubernetes pod that has issue with memory or cpu usage and that is not easy to reproduce in host operating system as it has more resource then kubernetes pod. if somehow we restrict the memory and CPU usage for process then it is possible to reproduce such scenario locally as well.

Just curious. there are any advantages or necessities to depend on the docker/podman cli instead of using the DOCKER_HOST solution?\r\n\r\nMostly to avoid a lot of headaches with authentication/access to remote endpoints; the endpoint could be a named pipe, a unix domain socket, http(s), or even SSH, plus it (hopefully) is protected with certificates or other credentials, which would also need to be configured. Since Docker (or Podman) have already abstracted away all those connection details for us, it ends up easier to depend on the CLI (plus it has the added bonus of guaranteeing that any commands we run, the user can run the same command from the CLI and get the same results).\r\n\r\nAs for not finding `docker` on the path, first troubleshooting step I\u0027d do would be to restart any VS/VSCode/shell instances that were running before you installed the CLI, since they wouldn\u0027t be able to see any changes to environment variables made after they were launched.

Therefore, service B ends due to an exception, such as the subscription dependency of Dapr sidecar. on the RabbitMQ service queue.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.AddRabbitMQContainer(\"rabbitmq\")\r\n    .WithVolumeMount(\"./configs/rabbitmq/enabled_plugins.conf\", \"/etc/rabbitmq/enabled_plugins\")\r\n    .WithVolumeMount(\"./configs/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf\", \"/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf\")\r\n    .WithEndpoint(1883, 1883)\r\n    .WithEndpoint(15672, 15672)\r\n    .WithEndpoint(5672, 5672)\r\n    .WithEnvironment(\"TZ\", \"Asia/Shanghai\");\r\n\r\nvar apiService = builder.AddProject\u003cProjects.AspireApp_ApiService\u003e(\"apiservice\");\r\nvar apiServiceDapr = apiService.WithDaprSidecar(sidecarBuilder =\u003e\r\n{\r\n    sidecarBuilder.WithOptions(new DaprSidecarOptions\r\n    {\r\n        AppId = \"apiservice\",\r\n        ResourcesPaths = [\"./components\"],\r\n        LogLevel = \"debug\"\r\n    })\r\n    .WithEnvironment(\"AMQP_CONNECTION_STRING\", \"amqp://test:hellotest@localhost:5672\")\r\n    .WithEnvironment(\"MQTT_CONNECTION_STRING\", \"tcp://test:hellotest@localhost:1883\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\nIn the above code, the container has been started, but RabbitMQ in the container has not yet been started. At this time, the Dapr sidecar has been started and requires the RabbitMQ service. However, because the service cannot be found, the Dapr sidecar stops working and there is nothing to set. Try the restart strategy, and then although RabbitMQ has started successfully, Dapr becomes dead.\r\n\r\nWish there was an option to automatically try to restart after failure, so that would solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThe container can be restarted after failure through startup parameter settings, but I don\u0027t want to containerize the Dapr sidecar, so there is no option to restart.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nsidecarBuilder.WithRestartAlways()\r\n.WithRestartAlways(10) // 10 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully something like this setup.\r\n",

This doesn\u0027t allow me to set env. variables or anything like that, but it does allow me to see the logs and start (not stop 😆 ) resources. This system is very flaky and at least one of the resources fails to start every time I start up Aspire, so being able to add say a `.WithRetries(5)` to all of these resouces would be great.\n\nYes, it would be a hack to get a hack running smoother, but if I encountered this situation I\u0027m sure others would too.",

Are you using Docker Desktop, Podman, something else? And are you able to get the mount configured correctly by using Docker CLI directly? If so, please share the command. \r\n\r\nHere is what I *think* is happening. If you are running your Aspire program from Windows, which seems like you do, I am not aware of a solution that would allow you to bind-mount the Docker socket from Windows host into your container. There simply is no \"Docker socket\" on the Windows host--e.g. Docker Desktop uses a named pipe instead https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/general/#how-do-i-connect-to-the-remote-docker-engine-api and I do not think the bind mount syntax will work to proxy between Unix domain socket on the container side and a Windows named pipe on the Windows host side.\r\n\r\nYour best bet is probably to run your Aspire program from within WSL subsystem, then\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbuilder.WithBindMount(\"/var/run/docker.sock\", \"/var/run/docker.sock\", isReadOnly: true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould work, assuming the Docker socked is available from within WSL subsystem.\r\n\r\n@danegsta please chime in if I confused something here.",

I think I know what is going on.\r\n\r\nLooks like Docker Desktop is treating the host path `/var/run/docker.sock` in a very special way. It allows to \"bind mount\" that path into the container even though it does not exist on the host machine at all; instead it silently creates a bind mount into Docker daemon VM. I am quite surprised that it works and I could not find anything about this special treatment in the Docker Desktop documentation, but it kind of makes sense.\r\n\r\nAspire should probably special-case this mount source (`/var/run/docker.sock`) as well. Specifically\r\n\r\n- `WithAnnotation()` results in an unnecessary `C:\\var\\run\\docker.sock` folder being created because Aspire (DCP specifically) is trying to be helpful and noticed that you are attempting a bind mount from a folder that does not exist on the machine. So it is trying to create that folder for you. We should stop doing that for `/var/run/docker.sock`.\r\n\r\n-  `WithContainerRuntimeArgs()` may not work simply because there should be two paramenters passed to it, that is, the way to call it is `WithContainerRuntimeArgs(\"-v\", \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\")`. Would appreciate a verification here; this should work.\r\n\r\n- `WithBindMount()` does not work because Aspire is trying to compute the absolute path to `/var/run/docker.sock` and failing at that https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/src/Aspire.Hosting/ContainerResourceBuilderExtensions.cs#L80 We should not do this for `/var/run/docker.sock` source.",

        "body":  "*Context: this is based on [discussions](https://discord.com/channels/732297728826277939/1281287950491193436/1292211397052207146) with @davidfowl on Discord.*\n\nWhen running on Docker Desktop, there is magic allowing a container to talk to the host, by using the special hostname `host.docker.internal`. However, this is not available on all environments. e.g. it likely doesn\u0027t work in the following cases:\n1. Docker in WSL (see this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63898430/how-can-i-access-a-service-running-on-wsl2-from-inside-a-docker-container))\n1. Docker engine on Windows without Docker Desktop\n1. Podman\n1. Docker Engine on Linux\n\nThis issue exists both for http and https traffic, but https presents an additional level of complexity. Even with Docker Desktop, it is problematic because containers don\u0027t have the self-signed cert that would allow them to talk to the host. ANd even if they did, it wouldn\u0027t work because the cert is only for `localhost`, and not `host.docker.internal`.\n\nOne potential solution is to use a reverse tunnel, similar to what @davidfowl does in https://github.com/davidfowl/YarpTunnelDemo. The trick that makes this work is that the communication is initiated from the Host to the proxy container, and not from a Container to the Host. And yet, its reverse nature effectively allows Container to Host communication, without ever needing to talk to a host port.\n\nHere is an illustration (courtesy of @davidfowl):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20ed367b-e97b-4fd7-94d0-269a642e113e)\n",

Basic idea was to create a proxy container that would act as one side of a tunnel to route traffic through DCP and out to the host services.\n\nWe considered something like the SOCKS protocol, but we have to establish the connection between host and container on the opposite direction of a normal proxy flow. Karol has been doing some research into various proxy libraries to see if any off the shelf implementations can already do what we need and I wrote up an initial draft of a possible SOCKS inspired protocol we could use if we needed to implement the proxy ourselves.

This allows the proxy to communicate with localhost services since it runs on the host network rather than in the Aspire container network.\n\nWill this issue be addressed in next version?",

Get the gateway IP (the “via” address):\n\n   ```powershell\n   wsl -d podman-machine-default -- ip -4 route show default\n   ```\n\n   Example output: `default via 172.20.112.1 dev eth0 …` → gateway = `172.20.112.1`.\n2. Run containers with:\n\n   ```\n   --add-host=host.containers.internal:\u003cgatewayIP\u003e\n   ```\n3. Ensure services inside containers listen on `0.0.0.0`.\n\n### Workaround (macOS)\n\n1. Get the gateway IP from the Podman VM:\n\n   ```bash\n   podman machine ssh podman-machine-default ip -4 route show default\n   ```\n\n   Example: `default via 192.168.127.1 dev eth0 …` → gateway = `192.168.127.1`.\n2. Run containers with:\n\n   ```\n   --add-host=host.containers.internal:\u003cgatewayIP\u003e\n   ```\n3. Ensure services inside containers listen on `0.0.0.0`.\n\n\u003e Tip: You can make the mapping global by setting `host_containers_internal_ip = \"\u003cgatewayIP\u003e\"` in `~/.config/containers/containers.conf` (macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\\.config\\containers\\containers.conf` (Windows).\n\n---\n\n### Networking boundaries\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    C[Container\u003cbr/\u003eService bound to 0.0.0.0] \n    B1[Barrier: Podman VM network bridge]\n    VMGW[host.containers.internal\u003cbr/\u003e→ 172.20.x.1 gateway]\n    B2[Barrier: WSL/Podman VM boundary]\n    W[OS Host\u003cbr/\u003eService bound to 0.0.0.0:PORT]\n\n    C -- \"requests → host.containers.internal:PORT\" --\u003e B1\n    B1 --\u003e VMGW\n    VMGW -- \"forwards to 172.20.x.1\" --\u003e B2\n    B2 --\u003e W\n\n    classDef barrier fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 3;\n    class B1,B2 barrier;\n```\n\n---\n\n**Result:** Containers can reliably reach host-side services via `host.containers.internal` on both Windows and macOS, with services inside containers reachable through the Podman VM gateway.\n\nHere\u0027s some code you can use to isolate this to the aspire application:\n\nThis does change all projects and executables to bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost, so beware of that. It’s needed because when an app only listens on localhost, connections arriving from outside the container (via the Podman VM gateway) will be refused. Binding to 0.0.0.0 ensures the service accepts traffic on all interfaces, including the one bridged through host.containers.internal.\n\n**Security implications:\n\nBinding to 0.0.0.0 makes the service accessible on every network interface inside the container. That means if the container’s port is published (e.g., -p 5000:5000), the service will be reachable from your entire host machine (and potentially your LAN, depending on firewall/NAT settings).\n\nThis is generally fine in a local development setup where you control the network and are running against Podman Desktop/WSL.\n\nFor production scenarios, you typically wouldn’t want everything listening on all interfaces. Instead, you’d rely on container network isolation, ingress controllers, or reverse proxies to explicitly expose only what’s needed.**\n\nIn short: this is a pragmatic development-time workaround to make Podman networking behave consistently on Windows/macOS, but it shouldn’t be treated as a best practice for securing production workloads.\n\n\n```C#\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;\n\nnamespace Aspire.Hosting;\n\n/// \u003csummary\u003e\n/// Adds runtime adjustments that make containerized services reachable when running on Windows with Podman.\n/// \u003cpara\u003e\n/// Background: On Windows, Podman runs containers inside a lightweight Linux VM.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWe have a fairly simple Nodejs app spun up alongside SQL Server, Redis, Azure Storage and a .NET API. This works locally (across Windows, Linux and OSX developers), however does not work in GitHub Codespaces.\n\nOur Redis cache is called \"project-cache\", which in turn tries to set the environment variable `ConnectionStrings__project-cache`. I\u0027ve also set 2 manual environment variables to confirm the root cause:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69858bd7-bbc9-436d-9a41-af4c258d511c)\n\nOf the 3, only `ConnectionStrings__project_cache_test` is set.\n\nOn Codespaces using the default environment, it seems that DCP is not sending the Environment Variables correctly which causes this to be dropped. As it\u0027s a black box I\u0027m unable to see exactly where or why this would happen. It seems the use of `env` may be required depending on the shell, but I don\u0027t understand why the NodeJs acts differently from the .NET project.\n\nThe only solution currently is to remove the hyphen from the resource name within the AppHost.\n\nI know that this is a \"Codespaces thing\" but it seems that Environment Variables should be reliably set across all platforms / shells, which I\u0027m assuming means that DCP isn\u0027t quoting them / using `env` specifically in the NodeJS application type, as these Environment Variables **are** correctly passed to the .NET application.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEnvironment variables with hyphens in the name are set correctly in a NodeJs app.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAdd an Npm app to the AppHost with an environment variable containing a dash.\n\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddNpmApp(\"anything\", \"path/to/anything\", \"dev\")\n    .WithEnvironment(\"Something-Has-A-Hypen\", \"Anything\");\n```\n\nRun Aspire within Github Codespaces, note that the environment variable is not set.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     ubuntu\n OS Version:  20.04\n OS Platform: Linux\n RID:         linux-x64\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.403 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\n  9.0.100 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.20 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.20 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  None\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  DOTNET_ROOT       [/usr/share/dotnet]\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\n### Anything else?\n\nSeems to be a DCP issue.

I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s shell dependent.\n\nA workaround is to use `env` with a quoted string to set \"unusual\" environment variables which would let this be set correctly and ensure compatibility.\n\n`env \u0027ConnectionStrings__project-cache=localhost:63999\u0027 npm run dev` works for example.\n\nThe hyphens being allowed in names I\u0027m assuming is for Bicep, but as it\u0027s not compatible with environment variables being set in the way that they are, it may be worth at the very least restricting the names to not include hyphens there thus ensuring compatibility?",

The .NET app works, the NodeJS app does not work.\n\nIt\u0027s my opinion that Aspire should be aware of this and map the environment variables correctly in one way or another, either by calling `env` on platforms where it\u0027s available (less compatible), or adjusting the names to be globally compatible by removing these \"special\" characters cross platform, and adjusting the internal connection strings/mappings to suit.",

After the run I press Ctrl+C however aspire dashboard keeps running besides that it does not work anymore and I cant rerun it.\r\nthe dashboard can be accessed shortly after starting and it also prints that it starts playframework however it does not print everything and than the log just hangs and nothing works.\r\n\r\nif I use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar process = new Process\r\n{\r\n    StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo\r\n    {\r\n        WorkingDirectory = baseDirectory,\r\n        FileName = \"sbt\",\r\n        UseShellExecute = true,\r\n        Arguments = \"run -Dplay.server.http.port=9001 -Dsbt.server.autostart=false\",\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nprocess.Start();\r\n```\r\nbasically everthing works.\r\n\r\nIs there something I\u0027m missing?\u003c/div\u003e",

Please describe the problem.\n\nThe new Aspire 9 feature `ContainerLifetime.Persistant` is pretty cool to improve startup time.\n\nThe only issue I have is that the containers are still running after I close the solution in Visual Studio. \n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nCreate a third option to destroy the container on IDE close.\n\n```\npublic enum ContainerLifetime\n{\n    Session,\n    Persistent,\n    /// \u003csummary\u003e\n    /// Attempt to re-use a previously created resource (based on the container name) if one exists. Destroy the container on IDE close.\n    /// \u003c/summary\u003e\n    /// \u003cremarks\u003e\n    Workspace,\n}\n```\n\nI know this could be hard to implement because there are different IDEs to support but the process that creates the containers could possibly watch for it\u0027s parent process to be terminated to destroy the containers (Even that wouldn\u0027t be fail safe because I always can open another solution in VS or open another Directory in vscode.\n\nBut it would be a good start and it would be pretty useful to have the possibility as well.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

I\u0027m also using this database as part of several other projects, like test project.\nHere\u0027s my setup:\n\n```\nvar password = builder.AddParameter(\"sqlpassword\", secret: true);\nvar sqlServer = builder\n    .AddSqlServer(ConfigurationConstants.SqlServerConnectionName, password, 1433)\n    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)\n    .WithDataVolume(name: ConfigurationConstants.SqlServerDataVolumeName, isReadOnly: false)\n    .WithContainerName(\"sql-server\");\n\nvar sqlDatabase = sqlServer.AddDatabase(ConfigurationConstants.SqlDatabaseConnectionName);\n\nwebFrontEnd\n    .WithReference(sqlDatabase)\n    .WaitFor(sqlDatabase);\n```\n\nThe thing is: when my Aspire app si running, I can access the database on port 1433 from other applications, even SSMS. However, when I shutdown my Aspire project, this database is no more accessible, even though it\u0027s marked as persistent. The container is still there, but the random port is the only one that allows me to acces the database, not the 1433 that I\u0027ve specified.\n\nHave I missed something in my configuration?\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET 9, Aspire 9\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Specifying `.WithEndpointProxySupport(false)` will disable proxying on all endpoints for a given resource. It\u0027s highly recommended to set explicit host ports for your container resources to avoid potential port conflicts as the default behavior for un-proxied container endpoints is to expose the endpoint using the internal port for the container.\n\nWe made the new API experimental and opt-in because there\u0027s additional larger work that will need to happen to unblock enabling the behavior by default, but we wanted to still provide a straightforward workaround in the short term. You can try out the API in nightly builds or the upcoming 9.1 release.",

When there\u0027s a mismatch between the container and the host user, the container may have insufficient permissions to access to file (we\u0027ve worked around this before https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/4191)\n2. When the host for the docker container isn\u0027t the same as the machine calling WithBindMount, paths don\u0027t get mapped directly. \n\nI ran into this while trying to run our tests on github actions. Certain containers when using a bind mount need to set the permissions to make it accessible.\n\nWe should look into fixing these issues.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWhilst Aspire does show console output from docker, this does not include showing the progres of image downloads.  A larger image could take several minutes (particularly over a slow network connection).  From the aspire dashboard, it\u0027s indistinguishable as to whether the container start has gotten stuck, or if progress is being made on the download\n\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nWhen pulling fromt eh command line, the docker UI shows a progress bar.  It would be ice if this could be shown within aspire, or at least some kidn of spinner / icon to show that progress is being made.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02838319-3837-4461-8c9e-0812c7c0a3c1)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Please describe the problem.\n\nI\u0027ve been investigating a few issues with other developers recently where the root cause was a different container image being used to what I expected.  (See #7350  for more context)\n\nWhilst the source column on the dashboard does list hte contaienr image used, this typically refers to a (potentially mutable) tag, which means there\u0027s opportunity for docker to think the tag means something other than a human user thinks\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/483823fa-0c09-4c79-a8c3-3679ffab6bce)\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI\u0027d like to be able to see specifics about the specific base image being used\n```\n- Expose Digest of the image being used\n- Expose Labels from the running image\n- Expose `Created` date of the image from `docker image inspect`\n```\nDigest and Created date could be shown within resource details\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dae0882c-17ab-41a0-b693-d0d54e15b3ee)\n\nLabels could also be shown within resource details, or could warrant their own heading on the resource details page.\n\n\nA more extreme solution could also be to provide a UI that provides raw access to `docker inspect`:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0060d153-78e3-4af5-aa80-c55f5a4572d8)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Steps To Reproduce\n\nRun all the integration tests in one run session.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nN/A\n\n### .NET Version info\n\nSDK dotnet 9.0\n\n### Anything else?\n\n- I have created [a branch for the defect ](https://github.com/functario/functional-dotnet-examples/blob/bug/aspire/container-session/1_Object_Oriented/test/IntegrationTests/Alexandria.Local.IntegrationTests/Tests/Authors/AddAuthorTests.cs) from my work in progress project.\n- I have changed the way to do the migration in the [main ](https://github.com/functario/functional-dotnet-examples/blob/main/1_Object_Oriented/aspire/AppHost/Configurations/TestConfiguration.cs) branch with [WaitForCompletion()](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-aspire/blob/main/docs/fundamentals/app-host-overview.md#waiting-for-resources). Still the behavior is the same (3 containers remaining until the end of the test run).\n- I think the behavior was different with the dotnet 8 version of Aspire.Hosting.Testing. But maybe it was my code at the time...\n- The code hangs after the last test when running the 3 tests, with Debug log being like:\nThe thread \u0027.NET TP Worker\u0027 (31620) has exited with code 0 (0x0).\nThe thread \u0027.NET TP Worker\u0027 (22516) has exited with code 0 (0x0).\nThe thread \u0027.NET TP Worker\u0027 (6556) has exited with code 0 (0x0).\netc...\nbut each test runs fine by its own or two consecutive.",

(Similar to #5995, although this time with a different error).\n\nWhilst it would be nice to fix the underlying timeout error (although as I have no repro steps or additional logs, I\u0027m not sure this is a particularly actionable), I wonder if this class of errors issues really be logged at Error level - sure it\u0027s a failure from the perspective of an engineer working on DCP.  However the error doesn\u0027t seem to have any user impact, nor is there anything I can do as an aspire user to fix or mitigate it, so there seems little value in sharing it with the user - and particularly not as a bright red error that makes users think they\u0027ve done something wrong.\n\n```\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcp.start-apiserver.api-server.container-logstreamer.LogDescriptorSet[0]\n      Error disposing log descriptor    {\"ResourceName\": {\"name\":\"prometheusMetricsAdapter-bsqbtjgs\"}, \"ResourceUID\": \"946ef89e-b34f-4e9a-8ee6-cd558b90a2f4\", \"error\": \"context deadline exceeded\\ncontext deadline exceeded\"}\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThis error seems benign with no visible impact, so more like it should be at a warning level.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nOur team uses main codespaces for an easy 1 click development enviroment. Asipre has been great so far but we still get daily hicups which forces us to destroy and recreate the codespace, sometimes multiple times per day.\n\nI\u0027ll create a separate issue for the problems we\u0027re getting. This one happens sometimes when stopping and relaunching the project.\n\nAll the service seem to show up on the call stack but the dashboard errors up with this error:\n\n```shell\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpproc.monitor.os-executor[0]\n      could not stop root process\t{\"root\": 10637, \"error\": \"process 10637 not found: process start time mismatch, pid might have been reused: pid 10637, expected start time 2025-03-22T01:32:25.277Z, actual start time 2025-03-22T01:32:31.290Z\"}\n```\n\nIf I try to access the dashboard it will not load both from the localhost and the special codespace link that was added in aspire 9.1.\n\nThe services actually load up correctly and start up. The problem seems to be specifically on the dashboard.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5863ce6c-e419-4568-a7ea-bd1b76550a3d)\n\nAlso in the ports section I see that the dashboard does not have a running process asociated with it\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68434599-0a66-4ca1-9d82-f9fe3e06141f)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAspire to launch consistently without errors for long periods (A full day) of using the codespace.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nThis might be a hard one to reproduce as it does not happen immediately. It happens daily but randomly during the day to different developers while stopping and starting aspire regularly during development and debugging.\n\nIf any information I can provide or collaboration so that you can identify the issue I\u0027m 100% willing to help.\n\nHere is the devcontainer.json we\u0027re using\n\n```json\n// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json.

Other issue at #8244.\n\nThis one happens when during the day the vscode client that\u0027s running the codespace might have to be reloaded (Internet loss, codespace timeout, vscode update, etc), when connecting back to the codespace sometimes the Aspire processes never stopped but you don\u0027t have the debug controls available for the Aspire project.\n\nIn this case when you start the AppHost you get\n\n```\n System.IO.IOException: Failed to bind to address https://127.0.0.1:22010: address already in use.\n```\n\nThe process to start the App host crashes and all the silent processes keep running. Then the only options to fix this is to hunt down all the aspire processes to kill them or destroy and create the codespace again.\n\nWe ended up having to create a command alias \u0027killaspire\u0027 to look up all the processes for aspire and our projects and kill them so that we don\u0027t have to recreate the codespace so often.\n\nIn this issue, no processes show on the VsCode debug call stack\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/553dcf5b-9cd4-472d-9f92-fd8df26d2d74)\n\nYou get no debug controls but you can see the processes running on the \"Ports\" section\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef4e5b2-bec6-4ffd-864e-cb2adc1688e4)\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf the vscode window is reloaded, it should either:\n- Ideally show the current process Debug controls if it\u0027s still running.\n- Or the prior Aspire processes be terminated when we run the App Host again\n\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nLeft all my devcontainer config in #8244 \n\nFor this issue I managed to replicate it by:\n\n1. Running the App Host\n2. Force closing the VsCode window to simulate a reload or internet loss conectivity\n3. Connecting the codespace again via the VsCode client (At this point in the ports section you can see all of the running processes)\n4. Running the AppHost again to see the port already in use errors.\n\n\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```shell\nwarn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core.KestrelServer[9]\n      The ASP.NET Core developer certificate is only trusted by some clients.

However, when I try to access it using its container name, the service cannot be resolved.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect to be able to access services that are hosted in Docker containers by referencing them using their container names within my Aspire application.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIn apphost i add container to builder\n```csharpIn apphost i add container to builder\n```csharp\nvar openwebui = builder.AddContainer(\"openwebui\", \"ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui\", \"latest\")\n        .WithHttpEndpoint(3000, 8080, \"openwebui\");\n\nvar opnweb = openwebui.GetEndpoint(\"openwebui\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject\u003cProjects.BlazorApp\u003e(\"frontend\")\n    .WithReference(opnweb);\n```\n\nIn Blazor app, Program cs file, I add this\n```csharp\nbuilder.AddServiceDefaults();\n\nbuilder.Services.AddHttpClient(\"openwebui\", client =\u003e\n{\n    client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"http+https://openwebui\");\n});\n```\n\nBut every time I tried to access through HttpFactoryClient, i having error address not found\nHere i tried to get access to openwebui\n\n```csharp\n@page \"/counter\"\n@rendermode InteractiveServer\n@inject IHttpClientFactory HttpClientFactory\n\n\u003cPageTitle\u003eCounter\u003c/PageTitle\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eCounter\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp role=\"status\"\u003eCurrent count: @models\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cbutton class=\"btn btn-primary\" @onclick=\"IncrementCount\"\u003eClick me\u003c/button\u003e\n\n@code {\n    private string models = \"\";\n\n    private async Task IncrementCount()\n    {\n        using var http = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(\"openwebui\");\n        var response = await http.GetAsync(\"api/models\");\n        models = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nWhen i try to get access to opnweb, to get Host or Port i having error\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: The endpoint `openwebui` is not allocated for the resource `openwebui`.\n   at Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.EndpointReference.get_AllocatedEndpoint() in /_/src/Aspire.Hosting/ApplicationModel/EndpointReference.cs:line …\n```\n\nbut in environment variables it shows services__openwebui__openwebui__0\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nSystem.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: No such host is known.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nEvery time DCP starts a container using our default test template, you\u0027ll see the following two entries in the test output.  (Or the same thing in the app host if bumping DCP log level to info)\n\n```\n    info: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.ContainerOrchestrator[0]\n      runtime status\t{\"ContainerRuntime\": \"\", \"runtime\": \"podman\", \"status\": {\"Installed\":false,\"Running\":false,\"Error\":\"exec: \\\"podman\\\": executable file not found in %PATH%\\nfailed to start podman command \u0027Info\u0027\"}}\ninfo: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.ContainerOrchestrator[0]\n      runtime status\t{\"ContainerRuntime\": \"\", \"runtime\": \"docker\", \"status\": {\"Installed\":true,\"Running\":true,\"Error\":\"\"}}\n```\n\nThe first log entry looks like an error (it even has the word `error` in the body), and so is easy for someone unfamiliar with DCP to fixate on it, even though it\u0027s not a problem.  As we\u0027re exposing these logs to end users, can we put them in a format more usable by someone who doesn\u0027t know what DCP is.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\n- A single log entry to indicate which container runtime is being used (i.e. \"using podman runtime\" / \"using docker runtime\", \"Found docker \u0026 podman, using docker\")\n- Only report the detailed status of each runtime if DCP found neither docker nor podman.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThere is a wider issue around DCP logs being exposed through the app host - the dcp logs in general have a lot of internal information which I\u0027m sure is useful to a Microsoft engineer working on DCP, but to someone unfamiliar with DCP, the details and presentation can be scary and overwhelming.\n\nSome other examples:\n\n```\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.ContainerReconciler[0]\n      could not create the container    {\"Container\": {\"name\":\"nonexist0-dnueesrv\"}, \"Reconciliation\": 9, \"ContainerName\": \"nonexist0-dnueesrv\", \"error\": \"object not found\\ncontainer not found\\ndocker command \u0027CreateContainer\u0027 returned with non-zero exit code 1: command output: Stdout: \u0027\u0027 Stderr: \u0027\u0027\"}\n\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.ContainerReconciler[0]\n      failed to start Container\t{\"Container\": {\"name\":\"failure-uxasffqy\"}, \"Reconciliation\": 7, \"ContainerID\": \"f81b96b2a584facf8668015e8b4259f110235b76bf4e19cb6de0f3141574bb0b\", \"error\": \"container f81b96b2a584facf8668015e8b4259f110235b76bf4e19cb6de0f3141574bb0b start failed (exit code 210)\\nobject not found\\ncontainer not found\"}\n\nfail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcp.start-apiserver.api-server.container-logstreamer.LogDescriptorSet[0]\nError disposing log descriptor {\"ResourceName\": {\"name\":\"prometheusMetricsAdapter-bsqbtjgs\"}, \"ResourceUID\": \"946ef89e-b34f-4e9a-8ee6-cd558b90a2f4\", \"error\": \"context deadline exceeded\\ncontext deadline exceeded\"}\n```",

Please describe the problem.\n\nBased on discussion https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/discussions/2069\n\nI would like to configure CPU and memory usage in code (e.g., in `Program.cs`) for Aspire projects, without relying solely on Azure-specific or YAML-based configuration. Currently, there appears to be no built-in way to do this within Aspire itself.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIntroduce an API or extension methods in Aspire that let developers specify CPU and memory limits directly in code. This approach would allow local or code-based configuration that mimics production-like settings.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI initially thought this might be possible using [Azure.Provisioning](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Azure.Provisioning_1.0.0/sdk/provisioning/Azure.Provisioning/README.md), but after looking more closely, it seems Aspire does not expose CPU/memory configuration in code. Adding such functionality would greatly improve our development workflow.",

Please describe the problem.\n\n### Scenario\n1. Run Aspire application from Visual Studio or VS Code.\n2. Switch to VS, right-click on one of the projects that belong to the running application, choose \"Rebuild\"\n3. Observe Aspire dashboard\n\n### Expected\nThe dashboard should indicate that the project is not running when it is being rebuild\n- Resource state should be different from \"Running\"\n- Process ID should disappear (the old process ID is no longer valid)\n- The project should be considered \"unhealthy\"\n\n### Actual\nWhen the project is being rebuilt, there is no change to the project state in Aspire dashboard. This includes the case if the rebuild fails, which may take developer a long time to remedy.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nI propose we introduce a new state for projects/Executables: Suspended\n\n1. When rebuild starts, the Executable goes into Suspended state. There is new notification type for this that the IDE sends to DCP, which in turn notifies the Aspire dashboard.\n2. The IDE needs to send a Suspended notification for all active debug sessions that are affected by project rebuild.\n3. In Suspended state \n    a. The project/Executable is not running. Process ID is no longer available.\n    b. The project is considered unhealthy.\n    b. Dashboard can still request logs, but stop/restart gestures should be disabled.\n4. From Suspended state the Executable can only transition to Exited state, or Running state (upon receiving Session Terminated, or Process Restarted notifications, respectively).\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe work required here spans DCP, IDE execution protocol, VS/VS Code/other IDEs that might support this scenario, Aspire dashboard and Aspire resource health.\n\n@LittleLittleCloud @danegsta @JakeRadMSFT @JamesNK @adamint @rafaelldi FYI",

Please describe the problem.\n\nCurrently `.WithVolume()` only really works if your container runs as a root user.  If your container runs as anythign other than root, you won\u0027t be able to write to the volume\n\n```cs\nvar container = builder.AddContainer(\"sdk\", \"mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0\")\n    //https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/containers/8.0/app-user\n    .WithEntrypoint(\"sh\")\n    .WithArgs(\"-c\", \"\"\"\n        echo \"Creating file in /home/app/mount\"\n        mkdir -p /home/app/mount/dir\n        echo \"hello\" \u003e\u003e /home/app/mount/file\n\n        echo \"Creating file in /mnt/something\"\n        mkdir -p /mnt/something/dir\n        echo \"hello\" \u003e\u003e /mnt/something/file\n\n        echo \"Creating file in /tmp/something\"\n        mkdir -p /tmp/something/dir\n        echo \"hello\" \u003e\u003e /tmp/something/file\n        \n        echo \"Done\"\n        sleep 5000000\n    \"\"\".ReplaceLineEndings(\"\\n\"));\n\n// Run as non root (user == app)\ncontainer.WithContainerRuntimeArgs(\"--user\", \"1654:1654\");\n\n// Create volumes\ncontainer\n    .WithVolume(\"/mnt/something\")\n    .WithVolume(\"/tmp/something\")\n    .WithVolume(\"/home/app/mount\")\n    ;\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nIdeally I\u0027d like to see `WithVolume(\"/path\")`, just work for non root users, being writeable by the container user (assuming readonly wasn\u0027t set to true).  If not, some kind of overload to `WithVolume` so I can specify what permissions the volume should be created would be nice.\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have also experimented with the ContainerFiles api to see if that helps.  This grants all the appropriate permissions if I don\u0027t use a volume mount, but volume mounts seem to ignore these permissions.\n```cs\nvar mode = UnixFileMode.UserRead | UnixFileMode.GroupRead | UnixFileMode.OtherRead\n                    | UnixFileMode.UserWrite | UnixFileMode.GroupWrite | UnixFileMode.OtherWrite;\n\ncontainer.WithContainerFiles(\"/\", [\n        new ContainerDirectory{\n            Name = \"mnt\",\n            Entries = [\n                new ContainerDirectory{\n                    Name = \"something\",\n                    Owner = 1654,\n                    Group = 1654,\n                    Mode = mode,\n                    Entries = [\n                        new ContainerDirectory{\n                            Name = \"mount\",\n                            Owner = 1654,\n                            Group = 1654,\n                            Mode = mode }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n        ])\n    ;\n```",

So you could view this as eliminating one of two pain points, rather than moving a pain point from local dev to production.\n\nI wonder if we need some higher level filesystem type abstractions?\n\nWe now have a few different ways of getting files into containers (bind mounts, volumes, ).  Each of which has their own quirks, and the quirks also vary based on the environment you deploy to (docker vs compose vs k8s).  I suspect he majority of people don\u0027t really care how we get the files into a container, just that they\u0027re there.  The generic api could also help mitigate some of the magic concerns as you\u0027d expect a bit more magic from a higher level api, and those who dont\u0027 want that magic can fall back to the specific implementations.\n\nThis abstraction could also apply to non container resources (e.g. using `IAspireStore` for executable / project resources).  And in turn this abstraction would help with #8984, allowing you to specify files / directories in a way that applies to both container, project and executables (and more).\n\nMy initial thought for this was something like `.WithFile()`, `.WithDirectory()`, where inputs include File/Directory name,\u0027 permissions, initial contents\n\nBut then I feel like you\u0027ll want to reference these files programmatically (particularly with #8984 in mind where you don\u0027t know the TargetPath and will need a `ReferenceExpression` type thing, so maybe they need to be dedicated sub-resources.\n\n```cs\nvar sqlLite = app.AddFile()\napp.WithEnvironment(\"SQLITE_DB, sqlLite)\n```\n\n(Don\u0027t think these are final API shapes, just a few minutes of throwing initial ideas out from me)\n",

In version 8.2.2, I was able to create a Docker container (specifically for [mountebank](https://www.mbtest.org/)) with multiple exposed ports using Aspire. However, after migrating to 9.2.1, the same configuration fails to start the container.\n\nSample Code: `  var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n        builder.AddContainer(\"mountebank\", \"bbyars/mountebank\")\n            .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 5000, targetPort: 5000, name: StorageSharedService)\n            .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 9000, targetPort: 9090, name: \"control\");\n\n        await builder.Build().RunAsync().ConfigureAwait(true);`\n\nError: `Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.ContainerReconciler[0]\ncould not create the container {\"Container\": {\"name\":\"mountebank-qqtkwshe\"}, \"Reconciliation\": 3, \"ContainerName\": \"mountebank-qqtkwshe\", \"error\": \"object not found\\ncontainer not found\\ndocker command \u0027CreateContainer\u0027 returned with non-zero exit code 1: command output: Stdout: \u0027\u0027 Stderr: \u0027\u0027\"}`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAspire should allow the creation of a Docker container with multiple exposed ports, as it did in 8.2.2.\n\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Use Aspire 9.2.1.\n3. Define a container resource with multiple ports exposed (e.g., 2525, 4545).\n5. Run the app and observe container creation failure.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n`Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.ContainerReconciler[0]\n      could not create the container    {\"Container\": {\"name\":\"mountebank-jevkhtef\"}, \"Reconciliation\": 3, \"ContainerName\": \"mountebank-jevkhtef\", \"error\": \"object not found\\ncontainer not found\\ndocker command \u0027CreateContainer\u0027 returned with non-zero exit code 1: command output: Stdout: \u0027\u0027 Stderr: \u0027\u0027\"}`\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n.NET 8\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

Often, that specific error can indicate the Docker runtime itself is unhealthy (the docker command to create the container returned a -1 exit code).\n\nA good way to troubleshoot if something is wrong with Docker is to try to run a similar command from a terminal and see if it succeeds or fails. This should be the equivalent command for the example container and error you provided (Aspire also creates a network to connect the container, but we only need to worry whether that\u0027s part of the problem if this command succeeds):\n\n```bash\ndocker container create --name mountebank-abcdefg -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 -p 127.0.0.1:9000:9090 bbyars/mountebank:latest\n```\n\nIf that command succeeds it should output the ID of a new container that\u0027s in a `created` state (we create and start the container in two separate commands instead of a single `run` command). In the event that running that command fails, the next step is likely to restart your Docker runtime (or your whole machine) to see if the problem resolves on its own.\n\nIf the command ends up succeeding when run from the terminal, I can walk you through enabling debug logging for the orchestrator which can provide more details about the specific Docker command being run.",

And do you know what version of Docker you have installed (running `docker version` should give you client and server versions). Asking just in case there\u0027s a particular environment we\u0027re not considering in our tests/validation.\n\nAlso, if you check Docker while your app host is running, do you see a container added in a created state (not running yet)? If you\u0027re listing containers from the command line, you may need to pass the `-a` flag to include all containers. I\u0027m wondering if we failed to create the container or failed to inspect the container.\n\nRunning the app host with orchestrator logging enabled may reveal some additional information about what exactly is failing. If you set the `DCP_DIAGNOSTICS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `debug`, the orchestrator will write detailed logs to disk. By default it\u0027ll write logs to `$TEMP/dcp/logs` (where `$TEMP`) is your standard temp folder. You can override that output path by setting the `DCP_DIAGNOSTICS_LOG_FOLDER` environment variable to the folder path you\u0027d like us to write the logs to.\n\nIf you run your project and reproduce the error with those environment variables set, you\u0027ll see a number of log files get written; the one that\u0027ll be the most interesting will have `dcpctrl` in the name as that\u0027s the actual orchestration logs (you may have multiple log files with `dcpctrl` in them if you run your project multiple times with logging enabled; the log files have the timestamp they were created as part of their name, so they should be in order by time created by default).\n\nOnce you\u0027ve reproduced the error with logging enabled, you\u0027ll want to try to find the `could not create the container` error in your `dcpctrl` log file. There should be additional diagnostic logging around there indicating what command was run (and what the output and error code was). Look for a log entry with a `docker create` command as that should give you the exact command we ran to create the container (as well as the ID of the container if we think it was created successfully). That create command log entry (or others between it and the error) may help indicate what\u0027s actually going wrong. Just be careful to check any entries you share from those detailed logs for personal information before posting them.",

I don\u0027t see any relevant logs in the Cisco client\u0027s logs.\n\nI suspect this issue is either a misconfiguration on the laptop or related to the Cisco client, but I am unable to find any relevant logs pointing to the root cause.\n\nThis is a continuation of a question posted to reddit on /r/dotnet and was requested to continue the troubleshooting here. https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1kob27m/cant_get_aspire_with_postgres_to_run_on_one/\n\nTagging the people I was talking with on reddit, as well as another that I was requested to tag the github issue with.\n@karolz-ms @maddymontaquila @davidfowl \n\nThank you!\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAspire application should load the dashboard when navigating to the URL supplied in the terminal\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nClone https://github.com/ChristopherRWilson/AspireWontLoad\n\nAttempt to run the AspireWontLoad.AppHost project\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nOnly on this one computer, I get the following output in the terminal window.

Later my main account was given local admin rights and everything should be running under that account. My co-worker\u0027s PC was set up from the beginning using his main account which did have local admin rights. That\u0027s the only thing I can think of different. \n\nIf anyone can point me in a direction to keep digging here, I\u0027d really appreciate it. Whether it may be resetting permissions somewhere, or where to look at the relevant logs.\n\nIt sounds like this may be an issue with the orchestrator not being able to set up the networking, but I\u0027m completely lost past that.\n\nThank you!",

This to me feels like it should be a different lifetime e.g. `ContainerLifetime.RunOnce`.  Or perhaps a `.WithRunOnce()` on the container along the lines of `.WithExplicitStart()`.\n\nIf Aspire were to do something special with persistent containers when they exit, I\u0027d more expect aspire to auto re-start the service to ensure it\u0027s running.

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf a resource that has a proxy that DCP can\u0027t start because port is in use, DCP will incorrectly report that the resource is running. For example:\n\n```cs\nvar s1Echo = builder\n    .AddContainer(\"s1-echo\", \"hashicorp/http-echo\")\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(8080, targetPort: 5678);\n\ns1Echo\n    .WithEnvironment(\"ECHO_TEXT\", $\"Hello from {s1Echo.GetEndpoint(\"http\")}\");\n```\nIf port 8080 is in use then DCP will report the resource is running and green in the dashboard. In the background it will retry for a long time to start the proxy on 8080. Trying to access the resource using 8080 will fail. This is confusing to the user because the resource reports it is running successfully.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5be0f16-5fd3-4a71-9243-949dc81bc714)\n\nDCP eventually it writes an error message to the app host console:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de35d78-6541-417b-af03-0ceddf064d4d)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe resource should be in a `Starting` state until the proxy at 8080 is running. If DCP can\u0027t run the proxy then the resource should go into a `FailedToStart` state. Right now there is a very long timeout when trying to start the proxy. I think 30 seconds is probably the max we should make users wait before giving them feedback.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nOn VS.net, and Rider especially but also VS Code periodically, one or more of my projects (micro services) in the Aspire host will break on an error spinning up Kestrel and attaching to a port.  Occasionally the port that doesn\u0027t get released is the Aspire Dashboard itself.\n\nThere doesn\u0027t seem to be any rhyme nor reason to it. It isn\u0027t about stop then start right away or clicking restart, it just doesn\u0027t release the ports and you have to close the IDE entirely and then it will work again on reopen.  Very occasionally that doesn\u0027t work and you have to restart.\n\nThis happens on 3 separate Aspire projects that share only a little in common, and happens on Mac (VS Code and Rider) and Windows 11 Stable (all 3)\n\nOnce while using VS code, I looked in in the task manager and none of the dotnet processes had been killed. I killed them and restarted and it worked again.  In Vs.net I don\u0027t see similar but am wondering if it\u0027s named something else when debugging so I don\u0027t see it.\n\nI generally just click the stop button in the IDE, I don\u0027t close the aspire dashboard or anything else.\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nShould regularly start without having to close the IDE and reopen.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a marginally complex Aspire Host with database, Local AI (ollama), and Redis.\n2. Make sure you have 3 or 4 .net 9 projects running minimal apis that spin up and use these things.\n3. Start the aspire dashboard for debugging.\n4. Stop the session using the IDE Stop button.\n5. Start a new session with the start button. (or hit restart)\n6. About once out of every 5-10 launches it will error with port conflicts with breakpoints into the kestrel startup.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nPort in use\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.301\n Commit:            a596cd22e2\n Workload version:  9.0.300-manifests.f856936c\n MSBuild version:   17.14.5+edd3bbf37\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.301\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [android]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    35.0.61/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.android\\35.0.61\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [aspire]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    8.2.2/8.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\8.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.aspire\\8.2.2\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [ios]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.9291/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.ios\\18.4.9291\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maccatalyst]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    18.4.9291/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst\\18.4.9291\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.51/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\9.0.51\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\n [wasm-tools]\n   Installation Source: SDK 9.0.300, VS 17.14.36203.30\n   Manifest Version:    9.0.6/9.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\9.0.100\\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current\\9.0.6\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:              Msi\n\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.6\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       3875b54e7b\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  8.0.411 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  9.0.301 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.17 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 9.0.6 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  E:\\Repos\\Api\\global.json\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\nOur projects have this in them to configure kestrel.

When running Aspire in VS, service projects are launched by VS to allow the full debugging experience if necessary (even when doing a run without debugging). If you\u0027re running your application with debugging, VS should be aggressively terminating the AppHost and service projects as soon as debugging stops (VS notoriously doesn\u0027t allow for graceful process shutdown when debugging, it just terminates the whole process tree) which should immediately release the bound ports.\n\nOne thing to double check that has come up before is to make sure that you don\u0027t have your IDE configured to run multiple startup projects; if a service project is configured as a startup project along with the AppHost, you can end up with two copies trying to run at the same time which will definitely lead to port conflicts as they\u0027ll both try to bind to the same configured port.",

That issue was marked completed but it only fixed symbolic links. Mounts still don\u0027t work.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAspire shall launch normally even if `NUGET_PACKAGES` are in a mounted-as-folder dev drive.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. (on Windows) Create a dev drive (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/#how-to-set-up-a-dev-drive) and mount the dev drive as a folder (for example E:\\taoyouh\\dev)\n2.

Can some of this disposal be made asynchronous to allow my next test to start sooner.  Sure, this is only an extra 5 seconds or so, but multiply that by 5 seconds per test and the effect can quickly add up.\n\n(This in some ways is a continuation of #8424 - simple tests are not takign as long as in that issue, but still longer than I\u0027d have thought / hoped.)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nTest case (using Nunit)\n```cs\n    private static readonly TimeSpan DefaultTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);\n\n    [Test]\n    public async Task Test()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        var cancellationToken = TestContext.CurrentContext.CancellationToken;\n\n        var appHost = DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder.Create();\n        appHost.Services.AddLogging(logging =\u003e\n        {\n            logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);\n            // Override the logging filters from the app\u0027s configuration\n            logging.AddFilter(appHost.Environment.ApplicationName, LogLevel.Debug);\n            logging.AddFilter(\"Aspire.\", LogLevel.Debug);\n            logging.AddSimpleConsole(x =\u003e x.TimestampFormat = \"HH:mm:ss.fff \");\n        });\n\n        //appHost.AddContainer(\"nginx\", \"nginx\")\n        //    .WithEntrypoint(\"bash\")\n        //    .WithArgs(\"-c\", \"echo hello world; exit 0\");\n\n        appHost.AddExecutable(\"cmd\", \"cmd.exe\", \".\")\n            .WithArgs(\"/c\", \"echo HELLO WORLD\\nexit 123\");\n\n        var app = await appHost.BuildAsync(cancellationToken).WaitAsync(DefaultTimeout, cancellationToken);\n\n        try\n        {\n            await app.StartAsync(cancellationToken).WaitAsync(DefaultTimeout, cancellationToken);\n        }\n        finally\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Start disposal\");\n            var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();\n            await app.DisposeAsync();\n            stopwatch.Stop();\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Test disposed in {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms\");\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nOutput\n```\n Test\n   Source: WebTests.cs line 12\n   Duration: 5.6 sec\n\n  Standard Output: \n19:38:58.242 dbug: Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Internal.Host[1]\n      Hosting starting\n19:38:58.270 info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Aspire version: 9.4.0-preview.1.25355.1+8e2d33c6570641dd90de2089f6e12bc56034968d\n19:38:58.270 info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Distributed application starting.\n19:38:58.270 info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Application host directory is: S:\\SdkContainerPackage\\SdkContainerPackage.Tests\n19:38:58.272 dbug: Aspire.Hosting.Cli.BackchannelService[0]\n      Backchannel socket path was not specified.\n19:38:58.402 info: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.DcpHost[0]\n      Starting DCP with arguments: start-apiserver --monitor 33464 --detach --kubeconfig \"C:\\Users\\alex\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\aspire.yglbgkwj.dys\\kubeconfig\"\n19:38:58.418 dbug: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.DcpExecutor[0]\n      Watching over DCP Container resources.\n19:38:58.418 dbug: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.DcpExecutor[0]\n      Watching over DCP Endpoint resources.\n19:38:58.418 dbug: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.DcpExecutor[0]\n      Watching over DCP Service resources.\n19:38:58.418 dbug: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.DcpExecutor[0]\n      Watching over DCP Executable resources.\n19:38:58.452 dbug: Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel.ResourceNotificationService[0]\n      Resource nginx/nginx-utvukexm changed state: Starting\n19:38:58.842 info: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcp.start-apiserver.api-server[0]\n      Starting API server...\n19:38:58.861 info: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcp.start-apiserver.api-server[0]\n      API server started\t{\"Address\": \"::1\", \"Port\": 58458}\n19:38:58.861 info: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcp.start-apiserver.dcp-host[0]\n      Starting DCP controller host\n19:38:58.861 info: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcp.start-apiserver.dcp-host[0]\n      Started all services\t{\"count\": 1}\n19:38:58.985 info: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl[0]\n      starting controller manager\n19:38:59.131 dbug: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.KubernetesService[0]\n      Successfully read Kubernetes configuration from \u0027C:\\Users\\alex\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\aspire.yglbgkwj.dys\\kubeconfig\u0027 after 691 milliseconds.\n19:38:59.203 info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]\n      Distributed application started.

For reasons that are not entirely clear to me it takes approximately 5 seconds for each Executable to get and process that event... with result that it takes about 6-7 seconds total to dispose of the app, and that time is dominated by Executable cleanup. Adding Containers makes no difference.\n\nFor comparison, on Linux I see the app disposal taking approximately 1.5 seconds for Executable-only version and about 2.5 seconds for version with Containers, which I think is reasonable.",

It only means the Aspire app model has created all the objects and got the information it needs to consider the application \"started\". For both Executables and Containers DCP might still be manipulating them, and it could be that some of these actions need to reach their outcome before cleanup can be started. E.g. this explains why a network created event shows up for some runs with your test--it is a timing issue. In my testing I actually added a delay after `app.StartAsync()` and measured shutdown time only after that, to make sure the shutdown starts from a stable state.\n\nThe cleanup itself is also a bit involved. E.g. for Containers we stop them gracefully, then verify they are really stopped, then remove them, then verify they are actually removed, then (after all ephemeral containers have been removed) delete the container network, then verify it is deleted. So that involves multiple round-trips to Docker/Podman and just takes time (and you do not want to know why we do all the verification 😄). Unlike with startup, we want to make 100% sure that the cleanup is done, all of it, before reporting the shutdown complete, because another instance of the same test might be started right after we report cleanup done, and if there are any resources still running at that time, conflicts may occur.\n\nI looked at the detailed logs and, apart from the CTRL+BREAK issue on Windows, I did not see any evidence of clearly excessive time spent in any phase of the resource cleanup.",

When you use `WaitFor(), `StartAsync` gets blocked by all of those dependencies starting.  But use `WithExplicitStart()` instead and that doesn\u0027t block.  \n\n\u003e we want to make 100% sure that the cleanup is done, all of it\n\nWhat if I don\u0027t care, or the time saving is significant enough that I want to take the risk of some edge case failures?\n- When I\u0027m running tests in a test process, why can\u0027t the cleanup of the previous test overlap with the running of the next test?   I can already run tests in parallel, so I\u0027d imagine that overlapped cleanup is no different to a slightly higher degree of parallelism.\n- I\u0027m running on an ephemeral build agent.  Once my test are complete, the agent is going to be completely erased.\n\nSure 5 seconds cleanup for a test may not be unreasonably, but multiply that by 100 tests and it becomes significant.  It also produces a really poor first impressin as devs will typically start with a hello world type test, and it is these test where the disposal is most obvious, leading to poor first impressions.\n\nAll of this is also made worse by `DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder` encouraging the model of one app host per test, rather than an assembly wide one time set up.  (Whilst technically you can do the latter, it makes it a nightmare to get logs out of so failures become undiagnosable.\n\n",

When you use WaitFor(), StartAsyncgets blocked by all of those dependencies starting.  But useWithExplicitStart()` instead and that doesn\u0027t block.\n\n`WithExplicitStart()` implies the resource start is asynchronous and on-demand--it may be started at any time after creation, or not at all. The fact that `StartAsync()` does not block on such resources being started makes a lot of sense to me. @mitchdenny or @davidfowl might have more thoughts on that.\n\n\u003e What if I don\u0027t care, or the time saving is significant enough that I want to take the risk of some edge case failures?\n\nThere is `WaitForResourceCleanup` [option on DCP Publisher](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/src/Aspire.Hosting.Testing/DistributedApplicationFactory.cs#L204) that is on by default but you can turn it of [via extension method](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/main/tests/Shared/DistributedApplicationTestingBuilderExtensions.cs#L38). Please check it out and let me know if it helps!\n\n\u003e Sure 5 seconds cleanup for a test may not be unreasonably, but multiply that by 100 tests and it becomes significant. It also produces a really poor first impressin as devs will typically start with a hello world type test, and it is these test where the disposal is most obvious, leading to poor first impressions.\n\nI think Aspire makes it almost too easy to spin up multi-service, multi-container environments for tests 😆 OK, I am joking a bit, but the costs of these things does add up. My advice would be to do more environment reuse for multiple test scenarios and/or rely more on testing services in isolation.\n\n\u003e All of this is also made worse by DistributedApplicationTestingBuilder encouraging the model of one app host per test, rather than an assembly wide one time set up. (Whilst technically you can do the latter, it makes it a nightmare to get logs out of so failures become undiagnosable.\n\nI think this is a reasonable default and not just because of the log issue. If one throws diverse test scenarios at the same set of instances, there is an opportunity not only for failures related to individual scenarios, but also failures caused by scenario interaction. Which may or may not be symptoms of implementation defects, but surely make test specificity and robustness more challenging.",

Please describe the problem.\n\nWe are sharing a bunch of internal integrations for containerised version of our apps.  As our app is continuously delivered, we pretty much always want internal users using the latest version of our images, there are few options we could use to do this\n\n1. Reference the mutable tag (e.g. `latest` / `production` / `stable`)\n2. Use `WithImagePullPolicy(ImagePullPolicy.Always)`\n3. Use a fixed image tag / sha in our published component, and re-publish our integration package\n\nHowever each of these has drawbacks\n\n1. Referencing the `latest` tag will get you the `latest` container when you first run your app, but from then on it will keep on using the local version and won\u0027t ever update itself (unless someone explicitly re-pulls the image)\n2. `WithImagePullPolicy(ImagePullPolicy.Always)` will causes docker to fail to start if it cannot pull the image for any reason (no network, credential expired etc.)\n3. This only keeps the container up to date if consumers keep the nuget package up to date.  For continuously deployed apps, this could update the integration package several times a day which is a lot of updates - either manual or dependabot style prs).\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nSome kind of way that would allows us to try to get the up to date `latest` container, but allow falling back to a local one if you can\u0027t do so.\n\nSomething like the following would be awesome.\n```cs\nbuilder.AddContainer(\"redis\", \"redis\")\n    .WithImagePullPolicy(ImagePullPolicy.IfPossible)\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this won\u0027t be as simple as the existing pull policies - the current pull policies are somewhat standardized and are natively implemented in docker and kubernetes, so Aspire needs to do little more than pass an additional command line argument / yaml configuration\n\n- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy\n- https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#pull\n\nBut `IfPossible` would require Aspire doing a bit more clever work - My initial thought would be implementing of https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/5625#issuecomment-2614797582 - having aspire handle the image pull separately from starting the container.  In which case `IfPossible` would initially try to pull the image but continue on error.  The container could then start if the image is already in the local cache, or fail if it wasn\u0027t.\n\nFor publish, `IfPossible`, would likely need to translate to `missing` / `IfNotPresent`, meaning `IfPossible` only applies locally.\n\n### Additional context\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf you try to create an executable with a really long argument, you get a cryptic error about `metadata.annotations` being too long.  \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt would be nice if this could be a bit more specific by telling you that this was because the Arguments were too long.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\nCall `sqlcmd` with a long sql script as an argument\n\n```cs\nvar query = new string(Enumerable.Repeat(\u0027a\u0027, 262144).ToArray());\n\nvar sql = builder.AddSqlServer(\"sql\");\nbuilder.AddExecutable(\"dbMigrator\", \"sqlcmd\", packageDir)\n    .WithArgs(\n        \"-S\", serverExpresison,\n        \"-U\", \"sa\",\n        \"-P\", sql.Resource.PasswordParameter,\n        \"-Q\", query\n    )\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n```\n Failed to create resource dbMigrator\nk8s.Autorest.HttpOperationException: Operation returned an

Actually turns out to not be as simple as checking if the length of the arguments exceeding the kubernetes metadata annotations limit as several other pieces contribute to the annotations and the length of all annotations coming from apphost can be several KB over 256 and still not repro,  so after investigating in both Apphost and DCP there doesn\u0027t seem to be a definitive way to handle and emit a warning / error.  I guess a warning could be output but would be approximate.     \n\n@karolz-ms and I discussed and  think the better solution is to not duplicate the spec.args in annotations.  With a quick look I believe the arguments are stuffed into annotations for the dashboard to retrieve.  Perhaps a better approach would be to only add a key for the argument in annotations and look up the value when needed.",

Instead, one or more containers get stuck in the \"unhealthy\" state, and my projects wait indefinitely.\n\nThe strange thing is:\n\nIf I stop and restart the solution, or close and reopen, it usually works fine.\n\nThe issue occurs more frequently when I have multiple containers running together.\n\nThe issue seems related to startup timing/race conditions when multiple containers are being initialized.\n\nIt would be great if this could be investigated, since it affects developer workflow when using Aspire with multiple services.\n\nThanks! 🙏\n",

I double-checked this morning on my Mac (Apple silicon, same OS, Aspire starter template) to make sure 9.4.1 is not fundamentally broken, but it does not seem to be. I must admit I am not sure what is going on because we did not fundamentally change anything about how Aspire proxies are set up between 9.3 and 9.4 timeframe.\n\nIs the problem limited to just one machine, or do your coworkers see the same issue?\n\nWould you be willing to share a detailed DCP execution log for your app? If yes, this is how you can grab it: https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/5109#issuecomment-2259326110  Feel free to email it to me if you do not want to post it on GH.",

For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json\",\n  \"profiles\": {\n    \"https\": {\n      \"commandName\": \"Project\",\n      \"dotnetRunMessages\": true,\n      \"launchBrowser\": true,\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"https://localhost:17060;http://localhost:15185\",\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\",\n        \"DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\",\n        \"ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https://localhost:21258\",\n        \"ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https://localhost:22028\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"http\": {\n      \"commandName\": \"Project\",\n      \"dotnetRunMessages\": true,\n      \"launchBrowser\": true,\n      \"applicationUrl\": \"http://localhost:15185\",\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\n        \"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\",\n        \"DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT\": \"Development\",\n        \"ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"http://localhost:19199\",\n        \"ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"http://localhost:20186\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen your collegues run the app, can they do `netstat -ano` and look for the dashboard ports in use? If they find it is in use, can they try to identify the process that is using the port, if any? E.g. `ps -Id \u003cPID\u003e` from PowerShell prompt will tell you that.\n\nAlso, what happens if you change the ports in this file to some other values ?(**for the launch profile that you are using**, `https` is usually the default if you do not explicitly set the profile).",

But this seem to be something else. \n\nRunning from VS, VS Code or dotnet CLI seems to be make no difference.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPersistent containers with no configuration changes between runs should not be re-created. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n- Create a new project using the `.NET Aspire Starter App` template\n- Select Aspire 9.3\n- Check `Use Redis for caching`\n\nOnce created:\n- Change the Aspire AppHost SDK version to 9.4.1\n- Change version of Aspire.Hosting.AppHost and Aspire.Hosting.Redis to 9.4.1\n- Mark the Redis resource with `.WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)` and `.WithOtlpExporter()`\n\nThis will cause the Redis container to be re-created on each start of the AppHost from Visual Studio. Reverting the versions back to 9.3.1 solves the issue.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n_No response_\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nStarting an Aspire AppHost that contains container services on a Linux system with Docker installed from the Snap Store will cause the container deployments to fail when no explicit container runtime is specified:\n```\nContainer runtime \u0027docker\u0027 could not be found. See https://aka.ms/dotnet/aspire/containers for more details on supported container runtimes.\nThe error from the container runtime check was: docker command appears to be aliased to a different container runtime\n```\nThe issue seems to be at the DCP level:\n```\n$ ~/.nuget/packages/aspire.hosting.orchestration.linux-x64/9.4.1/tools/dcp info | jq .\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.15.20\",\n  \"commitHash\": \"f3bbebcdc637a7af175106dc55591cb9e9c56ed2\",\n  \"buildTimestamp\": \"2025-08-01T22:07:48Z\",\n  \"containers\": {\n    \"runtime\": \"docker\",\n    \"hostName\": \"host.docker.internal\",\n    \"installed\": false,\n    \"running\": false,\n    \"error\": \"docker command appears to be aliased to a different container runtime\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThe error message seems to hint at the fact that snap aliases do not link directly to the program\u0027s executable, but to a centralized snap entrypoint, e.g.:\n```\n$ ls -l /snap/bin/docker\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Aug 20 14:08 /snap/bin/docker -\u003e /usr/bin/snap\n```\nHowever, the project runs as expected when explicitly specifying `ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker`. It seems that, at the DCP level, this causes a different behavior:\n```\n$ ~/.nuget/packages/aspire.hosting.orchestration.linux-x64/9.4.1/tools/dcp info --container-runtime docker | jq .\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.15.20\",\n  \"commitHash\": \"f3bbebcdc637a7af175106dc55591cb9e9c56ed2\",\n  \"buildTimestamp\": \"2025-08-01T22:07:48Z\",\n  \"containers\": {\n    \"runtime\": \"docker\",\n    \"hostName\": \"host.docker.internal\",\n    \"installed\": true,\n    \"running\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe behavior of not explicitly specifying a container engine should be the same as specifying `ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nOn a clean Ubuntu 24.04 box, run:\n\n```\nsudo addgroup --system docker\nsudo adduser $USER docker\nnewgrp docker\nsudo snap install docker\n```\nInstall the .NET SDK from the Canonical backports PPA, as [documented](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-install?tabs=dotnet9\u0026pivots=os-linux-ubuntu-2404):\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:dotnet/backports\nsudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0\n```\nWith Docker and .NET installed, you can use [eShop](https://github.com/dotnet/eshop) as an example of the behavior described above.\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/dotnet/eshop \u0026\u0026 cd eshop\nsed -i \u0027s/9.0.200/9.0.109/g\u0027 global.json\n```\nWe need to replace the SDK version in the global.json file from `9.0.200` to `9.0.109`, because distros can only ship the [1xx SDK feature band](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build?tab=readme-ov-file#support), as that\u0027s the only source-buildable one so far.\n\nRunning the project displays the following warning:\n```\ndotnet run --project src/eShop.AppHost/eShop.AppHost.csproj\n\n...\nwarn: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.DcpHost[0]\n      Container runtime \u0027docker\u0027 could not be found. See https://aka.ms/dotnet/aspire/containers for more details on supported container runtimes.\n...\n```\nOn the other hand, specifying the container runtime explicitly works:\n```\nASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker dotnet run --project src/eShop.AppHost/eShop.AppHost.csproj\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\n_No response_\n\n### .NET Version info\n\n```\n$ dotnet --info\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.109\n Commit:            a1e39f97e5\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.d3740a48\n MSBuild version:   17.12.41+a1e39f97e\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     ubuntu\n OS Version:  24.04\n OS Platform: Linux\n RID:         ubuntu.24.04-x64\n Base Path:   /usr/lib/dotnet/sdk/9.0.109/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.8\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       a1e39f97e5\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.109 [/usr/lib/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.8 [/usr/lib/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.8 [/usr/lib/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  None\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  /home/ubuntu/eshop/global.json\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",
