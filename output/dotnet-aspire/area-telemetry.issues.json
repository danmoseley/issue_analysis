The \"x\" for each dimension row becomes a \"select all\" for that row, toggling all of the items to be on or off (although the latter would result in no entries, right?).",

Each measurement also has a tag whose value is the name of the component.  When I make the service export these to the Aspire dashboard over OTLP and don\u0027t set any filters in the dashboard, both the \"Graph\" and \"Table\" options in the dashboard apparently show _sums_ of the durations.  It would be better to show the maximum or the average, rather than the sum.

Configuring a container to trust a self-signed certificate that is already trusted by the host for development purposes (and only at development time) seems no different to what we do today WRT to trusting the ASP.NET Core Development Certificate for the purposes of localhost HTTPS testing. The trust would only happen when running during local development as the certificate is only for localhost anyway.\r\n\r\nUsing an unencrypted transport for OTEL means processes running as other accounts on the same machine during local development can potentially observe sensitive information being passed from apps to the dashboard\u0027s OTLP endpoint so we decided that behavior must be opt-in.",

This will cause the OTLP exporter to fail. This change was introduced in preview 6 as part of security work. In the example you provided of running the dashboard itself in a container, you\u0027re explicitly disabling the HTTPS transport via the `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` environment variable and creating only HTTP endpoints using `WithEndpoint`.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Thanks.

Or both HTTP and HTTPS.\r\n\r\nI had a similar setup... but moving from aspire 8.0.2 to 8.2.0 the dashboard will again show untrusted exception and an empty resources list, even with this configuration. ( forcing HTTP and allow unsure true )\r\n@JamesNK or @paulomorgado anything that changed that is not in the release docs ( because I can\u0027t find anything related to this )\r\n",

Can\u0027t explain the no connection issue - If you\u0027re still using Rancher make sure you\u0027ve on 1.17.0.\n\nIn terms of your config file, there are a few things that mean the config file is never likely to work\n- Since v0.104.0, you\u0027ll need to explicitly set the endpoint if you want to be able to access the collector outside of localhost\n- If your destination is https and you want to ignore TLS cert errors, you\u0027ll need to set `insecure_skip_verify: true`\n- If your destination is http, you\u0027ll need to explicitly tell the `otlp` exporter to not use tls `insecure: true`\n- You\u0027ll likely need to pass the otlp api key to authenticate with the aspire dashboard\n\nSee https://github.com/afscrome/AspireOtelExample/blob/main/AspireApp1.AppHost/otel-config.yaml for a working example.  That successfully forwards telemetry from projects on the host into the otel collector in a container and then back out to the dashboard.  You can verify this by looking for the `from-collector` attribute which the collector adds\n\n\u003cimg width=\"1317\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48ac1668-cc7d-4825-b803-bb8ad3ef6a94\" /\u003e",

You need to tell it to explicitly use http.  That said if this were the problem, the error you get should be `transport: authentication handshake failed: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake`.  The dial error you get suggests it\u0027s failing long before that point.\n",

                                           "body":  "OK so the issue here is that when containers want to talk to services running on the host machine (rather than other containers) they do so via a special host name, `host.docker.internal` or `host.containers.internal` (depending on whether you\u0027re using Docker or Podman). The Aspire Dashboard is running on the host machine and is hosting the OTLP endpoint via HTTPS. The cerficiate used for the HTTPS endpoint is the ASP.NET Core HTTPS dev cert, the same one used by all ASP.NET Core apps by default during development. This self-signed certificate is generally trusted on the host machine as part of the .NET inner-loop (either by VS/C#DK prompting you to trust it, or by running `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` manually), but it won\u0027t be trusted by processes running in containers, or executables that don\u0027t use the hosting machine\u0027s certificate store/infra for cert operations (e.g. Node.js). Additionally, the certificate is only valid for the `localhost` host name (i.e. that\u0027s the certificate subject).\n\nSo to make this work we need two things:\n\n1. The dev cert needs to have additional SANs (subject alternative names) for the special container network host names (`host.docker.internal` and `host.containers.internal`). In the future it\u0027s possible we\u0027ll expand this to other special reserved local-only host names like `*.localhost` to enable scenarios like #5508\n2. The dev cert needs to be trusted by any clients trying to access a service via an HTTPS endpoint using that cert\n\nFor 1, we\u0027re planning on updating `dotnet dev-certs` in a .NET SDK update so that the dev cert includes the SANs described. We\u0027d likely do that in a servicing release of the 8.0.xxx and 9.0.xxx SDKs. The dev cert infrastructure includes a mechanism to version the cert so that we can make changes like this and the new cert will be laid down for you when you update your SDK. You\u0027ll need to re-trust it of course but if you\u0027re using VS or VS Code with C# Dev Kit you\u0027ll be prompted to do so the first time you launch after updating your SDK, otherwise you\u0027ll need to run `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` yourself (like usual).\n\nFor 2, we\u0027ll productize the [capability from our samples repo](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/blob/main/samples/AspireWithNode/AspireWithNode.AppHost/NodeHostingExtensions.cs) that facilitates injecting the dev cert into Aspire resources (containers or executables) by exporting it from the host (using `dotnet dev-certs https --export-path`), setting an environment variable on the resource pointing to the cert file(s), and, in the case of containers, bind-mounting it into the container. Then each hosting integration can be updated to use this capability and do whatever other configuration is required to configure the specific container/executable to use and/or trust the dev cert (e.g. Node.js requires setting the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable to point to the paths of certificate files that you want to be trusted beyond the usual public root CAs). (Related dotnet/aspnetcore#60369)\n\nWe\u0027d like to be able to get all this done in an Aspire 9.x update. Soonest would be 9.2 but that\u0027s optimistic.",

Regarding container injection, can you provide a bit more detail on how that would work and what level of configuration one has to modify default behavior? I am concerned with the potential for bind mount clashes, or non typical workloads or custom dockerfile images that may not play well with steps to inject the certificate into the container. If the bind mount is customizable we could more easily incorporate it into our cert bootstrapping processes already present in our docker builds.\n\nWhat about the ability to simply set the certificate used by aspire (request #7627 above)? Depending on how simple that is, it gives the development team the ability to take ownership over authentication, and those with a mature approach already in place could simply use our existing generated certificates and immediately solve the problem. (we include all necessary subject alternative names in our short lived self signed developer certs already in play).",

If you want to take over completely, you can simply call an API to request the dev cert file path (Pem or Pfx format) and then take full control of how you want to inject it into the container.\n\nRE custom certificates, seems like a nice complimentary feature. For ASP.NET Core apps you can already specify the path to a cert on disk to use (via Kestrel configuration) so that shouldn\u0027t be a problem.

Is there a fix or an alternative way, maybe via HTTP?\n\nI want to run an OTEL Collector inside the Aspire AppHost, which would collect metrics from other containers, and I’d also like to display these metrics in the Aspire Dashboard. More specifically, I want to connect Keycloak metrics to the Aspire Dashboard (AppHost, not Standalone), but I just can’t get it to work. The issue isn’t with retrieving data from Keycloak into the OTEL Collector—that part works fine. I can see the metrics clearly in the debug console within the container. What I can’t manage is getting this data to show up on the Aspire Dashboard at the Aspire endpoint.\n\nI’ve also been trying the following example:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/tree/main/samples/Metrics\nIf I understand this example correctly, the metrics are exported to Prometheus and Grafana, but the setup still includes an OTEL Collector that has an Aspire exporter configured in its config (https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/blob/main/samples/Metrics/otelcollector/config.yaml).\n\nIt also uses the OpenTelemetry Aspire Collector (https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/tree/main/samples/Metrics/MetricsApp.AppHost/OpenTelemetryCollector), with certificate generation, hostname configuration, etc. But for some reason, I can’t get this sample to work either. Is anyone else running into the same issue?\n\nWhen I run it and check the logs in the OTEL Collector, I see the following. It’s not clear to me why it’s not working, since the collector runs inside a container and Aspire runs on the host…\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feed83e6-bc26-4369-a201-182bb8d95661)\n\nI also tried setting it to localhost just to see what happens, and I get the following logs:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8c62ab6-43b3-4101-9074-a8373c0c356d)",

As part of an experiment, I was able to get Kong gateway up and running in a container, turned on its OTEL plugin to send telemetry to another container which runs OpenTelemetry Collector. From there I pointed the exporter to the Aspire gRPC endpoint over HTTPs (I needed the collector to exports metrics which are not generated by the plugin). It works with the Aspire HTTPS endpoint but there is a catch. In the [OTEL Collector docs ](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md)you will find that the exporter has two parameters, one enables the exporter to talk to an HTTP-only (not https) endpoint (by default it expects an HTTPS target). The other parameter turns off TLS certificates validations. You will need to play with those flags depending on the ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT value you are using. When adding the collector container to the model use  WithOtelExportes(). I have not used the Aspire OTEL colector hosting extention you mentioned, I will test it. ",

This can be problematic for production scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis feature would help prevent the loss of log files during such reboots. While I don\u0027t expect the Standalone Aspire Dashboard to retain logs indefinitely, a grace period of 30-90 days would suffice for most production scenarios.\r\nThis feature would also prevent data loss when updating the Docker image, since that requires the container to be restarted.\r\n\r\nI wrote to @davidfowl on LinkedIn and [he mentioned that there are currently no short-term plans for long-term storage](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196405765631275008/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7196405765631275008%2C7196413519867588609%29\u0026replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7196405765631275008%2C7196422862423965698%29\u0026dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287196413519867588609%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7196405765631275008%29\u0026dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287196422862423965698%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7196405765631275008%29) ;-)\r\n",

That said, we do not want to build a data storage model optimized for querying logs, metrics and traces. My thought is that we would support a best effort flushing telemetry to disk on graceful shutdown (or on some interval) to handle the survival of reboots/upgrades. This isn\u0027t a scalable persistent store optimized for queries (this is where real APM systems excel). \r\n\r\nTo be clear on the intent here:\r\n- This dashboard should be considered a \"live view\" of telemetry with a fixed buffer size (configurable).\r\n- There\u0027s no plan to build a scalable backend storage or pluggable storage engine for the dashboard.\r\n- If you have a large-scale system sending lots of telemetry to the dashboard likely won\u0027t work very well (large cluster with thousands of services sending telemetry). This is why most large scale APM systems separate collection and analytics.\r\n- This would not be pluggable storage, we write to disk. I\u0027d like to avoid anything complex an extensible. You can mount a volume or copy that data blob if you need it to go elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",

So what if the goal was simply to support deployment of the collector and dashboard as a sidecar or standalone container. Like a modern version of ELMAH. It would help with troubleshooting the new publishing providers and discrepancies between the system in dev and in production. It\u0027s a natural extension of Aspire\u0027s new deployment features without committing to anything beyond the current project scope. \n\nI for one would love to integrate a little admin-only drawer on my site that proxied the dashboard so I can watch user activity in realtime and see how the resources are handling transition to their deployed homes. \n\n📎 It\u0027s possible this is already possible, I just had little luck deploying the \"standalone\" dashboard on AWS (which, \ncommercially, would be a nice place to establish a little beachhead and only fair as they cheekily took the Application Insights name for their own overwrought apm system)\n\n📎 Apologies in advance if ELMAH is already a modern version of ELMAH, just a good example of how a small scale troubleshooting extension provided value in the past.

Please describe the problem.\n\nAspire is somewhat different compared to what we have done in the past w.r.t. telemetry. Aspire includes a pre-configured solution, which if using an OTLP compatible backend, is ready for production. The developer doesn\u0027t need to implement any code for telemetry - what we supply in the project templates should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nHowever we don\u0027t include any sampling logic or policy as part of this default setup. This is fine for a small service, and test deployments, where you probably want to collect all the telemetry. However for production workloads, it will introduce a lot of telemetry data, which if sent to a monitoring system that charges based on data volume could create sticker shock for the customer.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nBetween Aspire and OpenTelemetry.NET we should provide a sampling component that can do sampling based on:\r\n- whether the incoming request has a traceid and sampling bit set\r\n- Either a probabilistic sampler - that uses a hash algorithm over the traceid to determine which requests should have tracing/logging included/dropped\r\n- A rate limiting sampler that will enable a fixed number of requests per time period to be included - such as 2 requests/s, using a leaky bucket algorithm to ensure that rate is met, but all requests have an equal chance of being included.\r\n\r\nThe sampling should be applied to Traces and Logs so that the requests that are selected for telemetry will get all their telemetry, and those that are filtered out will not.\r\n\r\nWe should include a policy in the Service Defaults project that uses this algorithm to give a sensible default for customers so they will get a representative sample of their requests, \r\n\r\nThe policy should be conditional on the development environment variable so that all telemetry is captured when running under the IDE.\n\n### Additional context\n\nJaeger has a default sampling policy that we can use for inspiration. https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.58/sampling/#client-sampling-configuration",

Please describe the problem.\n\nThe OTel semantic conventions tend to use a single metric to represent variations on operations, and then use dimensions to split the values. For example [gen_ai.client.token.usage](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/f79fe6b61438bfa0804df9c254c402fd0d71f42a/docs/gen-ai/gen-ai-metrics.md#metric-gen_aiclienttokenusage) is a metric for LLMs to represent the number of tokens used in a LLM call. The same metric is used for both input and output, but has a dimension `gen_ai.token.type` to identify which type it is.\r\n\r\nUsing the same graph line for these two usages is wrong - the values could be orders of magnitude different.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nThere should be an option to split the graph based on a dimension. As part of the dimension list, there should be a checkbox for each dimension as to whether to split the results - drawing independent lines for each value of that dimension.\r\n\r\nThis should probably only be available for a single dimension at a time - doing it for multiple will result in an explosion of lines and it will be hard to follow.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Please describe the problem.\n\nIn watching the session yesterday on DataDog and how you need to configure Aspire to be able to tweak the OTLP settings, I am thinking that we should probably have an OTLP app model component.\r\nToday if you want to send data elsewhere than the dashboard, you need to go add new environment variables to each application. Its kind of ugly.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nWe emit a whole bunch of OTLP vars today, but you don\u0027t get any control over them. I wonder if we should have an explicit component that you can add to the app model that is something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuilder.AddTelemetrySettings(\"otel\")\r\n    .UseDefaults(false)\r\n    .Endpoint(\"http://localhost:4317\")\r\n    .ServiceName(\"AspireApp17\")\r\n    .ResourceProperty(\"MyName\", \"MyValue\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat you can then reference from each project/ app/ container that you want to reference. \r\nIt would have the logic for all the attributes that we spit today, together with API endpoints over them, and other common settings. If you disable the defaults then it will no longer spit those.\r\n\r\nIt would make it easier if you were going to have an OTel collector component, as you can now point one of these at that.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Please describe the problem.\n\nThe Aspire dashboard provides an https OTLP endpoint for publishing observability data. Since it runs locally with dotnet dev-certs containers with their own isolated network are not able to publish metrics, traces etc. as they do not trust the dev-certs. In addition, dev-certs are only for localhost not host.docker.internal which is used to communicate with the dashboard.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nAspire should help with setting up HTTPS between container and non-container resources. This would allow developers to work with SSL locally in a painless way.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee discussion https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/discussions/5221",

Please describe the problem.\n\nAs an AI engineer developing Generative AI applications locally using VS Code, I aim to instrument and visualize OpenTelemetry (OTEL) signals captured within my app through the Aspire dashboard. Currently, I use the Aspire dashboard to monitor all telemetry signals, particularly to visualize end-user interactions by tracking captured input and output tokens. However, the current version of the Aspire dashboard lacks a user-friendly experience when rendering large text, making analysis difficult. Improving this experience, especially in rendering telemetry signals from AI interactions, would significantly enhance usability and analysis for Gen AI Apps.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a9a368d-1381-4c65-ad5f-4754a3e5bae5)\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nA solution to this problem would be to generate a tree view that organizes all the LLM spans within the same trace or session (correlation ID) and present them in a conversational format. This structure would make it easier to follow the flow of interactions, with each span displayed sequentially alongside its associated metadata, improving clarity and allowing for better analysis of the captured telemetry signals.\n\nBelow are representational sample of user-friendly rendering from market solutions\nArize \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91ca2903-65ce-4d62-bf55-c754fd3a6399)\n\nLangfuse\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/958c0f0d-3caf-4b2a-a346-b865a6e6d55e)\n\nPromtpy Tracing\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/453ae12b-86cc-497c-ad9d-3597a2885be4)\n\n\n\n\n@leslierichardson95  @truptiparkar7\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

This is doable - and could be applied to more than just the LLM space, such as http requests or database calls.\r\n\r\nThe dashboard is (currently) a generic viewer of telemetry, regardless of the source, whereas my understanding of Arise and Langfuse is that they are specific to monitoring LLM instrumentation, and are more of an LLM specific monitoring solution, more akin to Application Insights, but just for the LLM data?

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nAs an AppHost launching a browser app with both OTEL gRPC and http collector endpoints running, I\u0027d like to inject the OTEL http endpoint into some apps and the gRPC endpoint into others.\n\nAssume the following in AppHost\u0027s lauchSettings.json:\n\n```json\n    \"https\": {\n      // ... snip ...\n      \"environmentVariables\": {\n        // ... snip ...\n        \"DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https://localhost:21096\",\n        \"DOTNET_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL\": \"https://localhost:21097\",\n        // ... snip ...\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nAnd assume the following in AppHost\u0027s Program.cs:\n\n```c#\nvar browserApp = builder.AddNpmApp(\"react\", \"../react-app\", \"dev\")\n    .WithReference(apiService)\n    .WithHttpEndpoint(env: \"PORT\" /*, isProxied: true*/);\n```\n\nThe problem:\n\n1. Both the gRPC endpoint and the http endpoint are running.\n2. `.WithReference()` doesn\u0027t know which to inject.\n3. It guesses gRPC ... which in this case is the wrong answer.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nAdd an optional argument to WithReference specifying the protocol:\n\n```c#\n.WithReference(apiService, protocol: OpenTelemetryProtocol.Http);\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe work-around is to disable the gRPC endpoint in AppHost\u0027s launchSettings.json ... which makes all the other apps have to use http too.",

To get there quickly, I tried to paste the spanID into the filter input box, but it filters by name by default, so eventually the quickest solution was to find the correct `connection_setup` span manually by scrolling down and using the browser\u0027s search function:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5860e2f-3e1f-4ff1-a3e3-caa9f8f1b1e3)\n\nThis feels like a bug, or if it works like this by design, the UX is clearly sub-optimal.",

For instance, one simple example is that I\u0027m not 100% sure I understand what this statement means: `I\u0027ve created an Aspire starter project and added Docker support to the ApiService project using .NET SDK.` Does that mean that as part of building the project you generate a docker image for it?\n\nWe have found that the best way to make sure we are investigating the right thing, is to avoid having a layer of interpretation in between 😃.",

        "body":  "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe the problem.\n\nI was trying to use the Aspire Dashboard locally to visualize traces coming out of a Cloudflare Worker (an alternative JS server runtime), but it wasn\u0027t working as I eventually realized for 2 reasons\n\n1) The Cloudflare Worker-specific OTEL SDK only exports OTLP in JSON form (over HTTP). \n\ngRPC isn\u0027t supported at all from Cloudflare Workers afaik (since they\u0027re more browser-like than Node.js-like in this regard I think) and there\u0027s an existing issue for HTTP/protobuf support (https://github.com/evanderkoogh/otel-cf-workers/issues/68)\n\n2) The Aspire Dashboard doesn\u0027t support ingesting OTLP/JSON (as this comment I found seems to allude to https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/issues/3688#issuecomment-2181819178)\n\nI\u0027m assuming this is basically a non-issue for anyone in this kind of situation since you can just run an OTEL collector in the middle and have it translate to gRPC/protobuf that gets sent to the Aspire Dashboard, but I figured I\u0027d just write it up in case anyone hits a similar problem (I don\u0027t think I personally would have figured this out alone had I not been a little aware of the whole JSON vs binary stuff)\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nMaybe just document the lack of OTLP/JSON support somewhere? (though I might\u0027ve missed it when looking through the docs trying to figure this out)\n\nIdk if the actual feature really needs to be implemented or not.\n\n### Additional context\n\nNot very Aspire-like as I gather but here\u0027s a docker-compose.yaml file and an otel-config.yaml file to do the workaround I mentioned above\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  otel-collector:\n    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector:0.115.1\n    container_name: otel-collector\n    ports:\n      - \"4318:4318\" # HTTP receiver\n      - \"55679:55679\" # zPages for troubleshooting\n      - \"8888:8888\" # metrics for troubleshooting\n    volumes:\n      - ./otel-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol/config.yaml\n\n  aspire-dashboard:\n    image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.0\n    container_name: aspire-dashboard\n    ports:\n      - \"18888:18888\" # web UI\n      - \"18889:18889\" # receiver\n    environment:\n      - DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true \n    depends_on:\n      - otel-collector\n```\n\n```yaml\nextensions:\n  zpages:\n\nreceivers:\n  otlp:\n    protocols:\n      http: # Accept OTLP/JSON over HTTP\n        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318\n\nprocessors:\n  batch:\n    timeout: 5s\n\nexporters:\n  # debug:\n  otlp:\n    endpoint: \u0027aspire-dashboard:18889\u0027 # Send OTLP Protobuf to Aspire Dashboard using gRPC\n    tls:\n      insecure: true\n\nservice:\n  extensions: [zpages]\n  pipelines:\n    traces:\n      receivers: [otlp]\n      processors: [batch]\n      exporters: [otlp] # , debug]\n    metrics:\n      receivers: [otlp]\n      processors: [batch]\n      exporters: [otlp]\n    logs:\n      receivers: [otlp]\n      processors: [batch]\n      exporters: [otlp]\n```\n\n*I typo-ed the path to the collector config file initially hence all of the extra troubleshooting stuff. None of that is actually needed",

Please describe the problem.\n\nCurrently, in OtlpConfigurationExtensions.cs, OTLP configuration is skipped entirely when IsPublishMode is true:\n```cs\nif (context.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode)\n{\n    // REVIEW:  Do we want to set references to an imaginary otlp provider as a requirement?\n    return;\n}\n```\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspire/blob/6d8575a2e5d0171773298a8171ff85a58c873292/src/Aspire.Hosting/OtlpConfigurationExtensions.cs#L40C13-L44C14\n\nI’d like to propose that OTLP configuration should be made an optional setting, rather than being outright disabled in publish mode. This would provide more flexibility for projects that may want to configure OTLP endpoints or telemetry even when publishing.\n\n### Describe the solution you\u0027d like\n\nInstead of returning immediately, allow users to opt-in to OTLP configuration in publish mode via configuration or environment variable.\nProvide clear documentation on how to enable or disable OTLP in publish/publish-like scenarios.\n\nThis change would help teams who wish to collect telemetry in production or staging environments without having to patch the SDK or override this logic.\n\n### Additional context\n\nMy current workaround to get otlp configured in publish mode (mainly create correct env in docker compose file)\n```cs\npublic static IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e PublishOtlpEnvironmentPlaceHolder\u003cT\u003e(this IResourceBuilder\u003cT\u003e builder, IResourceBuilder\u003cParameterResource\u003e endpoint, IResourceBuilder\u003cParameterResource\u003e protocol) where T : IResourceWithEnvironment\n{\n    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(builder);\n\n    if (builder.ApplicationBuilder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode)\n    {\n        builder.WithEnvironment(\"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\", endpoint);\n        builder.WithEnvironment(\"OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL\", protocol);\n    }\n\n    return builder;\n}\n```",
