        "body":  "This issue stems from [review feedback from this PR](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/54223#issuecomment-863785611).  \r\n\r\nThe general issue is that the CrossGen project has a hard coded RID list it supports.  This hard coded list doesn\u0027t work for source-build, which needs to build arbitrary non-portable RIDs like `centos.8-x64` and [`banana.42-x64`](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/297) with no unexpected feature gaps vs. portable RIDs.  Currently, source-build conditionally disables the hard coded RID list but this could be improved.  It could have a list of \"good\" portable RIDs, and check if the current RID is a descendant of any of the \"good\" RIDs in the RID graph. Then, there would be no need for source-build-specific behavior, because `banana.42-x64` derives from `linux-x64`.",
