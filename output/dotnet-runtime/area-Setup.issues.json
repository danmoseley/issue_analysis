And there are no packages for the OS, too. So it\u0027s a bit of a mystery how to actually make .NET Core work on a Raspi.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a package for that OS. It should be as simple as that:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt install dotnet\r\n\r\nMaybe a custom package source needs to be added, but definitely no manual tar file works. Mono was easier to install when it was current like 5 years ago.\r\n\r\nSince the docker support on the Raspi with dotnet-runtime packages is very poor (multi-arch fails, need to select arm32 image specifically, can\u0027t get my app in a custom image), I need to install .NET Core on the Raspi OS itself.\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/coreclr#18732_\n\n---\n\n@RussKeldorph commented on [Mon Jul 30 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1828#issuecomment-409057915)\n\n_From @ghost on June 30, 2018 16:45_\n\nCurrent blocker for ARM32 in general is https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/8998. In my understanding it\u0027s about couple of lines of XML changes in dotnet/cli to pack the right binaries (like done for ARM64 https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/9011/files) and then testing cross build on x64 (which is a more involved task).\r\nThat said, CoreCLR/CoreFx/CoreSetup parts for ARM32 are done.\n\n---\n\n@RussKeldorph commented on [Mon Jul 30 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1828#issuecomment-409058152)\n\n@Petermarcu Wasn\u0027t sure how big the gap is or where this request should be tracked.

Have a Python 3.6 alpine base image\r\n2. Want to install Dotnet 2.1 core runtime in it using apk command or any other way\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nRun dotnet commands\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nCannot find any documentation or reference that shows such an example. \r\n\r\n## Additional information (e.g. issue happens only occasionally)\r\nDotnet core 2.1 runtime installations depends on debian packages. If I want to install dotnet core 2.1 runtime in a python alpine base image, it seems like not possible today?\r\n\r\nMotivations:\r\n\r\n- Installing python on a dotnet alpine is possible and works, but the reverse would render me a smaller image. Python installations on existing docker base files that are non python, always tend to occupy space. \r\n\r\n- People prefer a python base image for data science related work but when they want to run any dotnet based functions or DLL\u0027s this becomes a roadblock. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions appreciated to install dotnet core 2.1 in python alpine base image. (NOT looking to get a dotnet core 2.1 base image alpine and installing python on it - this exists)\n\n---\n\n@MichaelSimons commented on [Thu Jan 10 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/892#issuecomment-453323402)\n\n.NET Core does not currently support installation via apk packages.  If you want to install .NET Core on alpine, please reference how it is done in the [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/2.1/runtime/alpine3.7/amd64/Dockerfile) for .NET Core Alpine images.\n\n---\n\n@MichaelSimons commented on [Thu Jan 10 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/892#issuecomment-453324177)\n\ncc @dleeapho, @leecow - I\u0027m going to move this issue to core-setup as an ask for apk support.\r\n\r\n\n\n",

It installed without any errors.  I then closed all terminals and opened a new one, but the dotnet command doesn\u0027t exist.\r\n\r\nI\u0027m on macOS Mojave 10.14.4\r\n\n\n---\n\n@CPoffWebster commented on [Sat May 18 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2751#issuecomment-493705977)\n\nI have the same issue. It seems to download fine on macOS High Sierra, but not on Mojave.\n\n---\n\n@grosch commented on [Sat May 18 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2751#issuecomment-493720465)\n\nTheir installer is screwy.  This will fix your issue:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin/\r\n```\n\n---\n\n@CPoffWebster commented on [Sat May 18 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2751#issuecomment-493720585)\n\nThank you this fixed the issue!\n\n---\n\n@karelz commented on [Wed May 22 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2751#issuecomment-494959528)\n\n@dagood any idea who could help fix this in our installers?\n\n---\n\n@leecow commented on [Thu May 23 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2751#issuecomment-495283438)\n\nThe Mac installer does not create a symlink, it adds /usr/local/share/dotnet to PATH. We can discuss if changing the approach makes sense as well as try to figure out why PATH was not updated in this case. \n\n---\n\n@grosch commented on [Thu May 23 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2751#issuecomment-495317295)\n\n@leecow Updating the PATH is *never* the right thing to do.  You have no idea how the system or the user\u0027s environment is configured.  Every time you add to the path, for example, the shell has to re-find everything.  The path should be set one and only one one time for performance reasons.  \r\n\r\nRegardless, you\u0027re making an assumption as well that I\u0027m using Bash as my shell, for example.  I hate bash, I\u0027m using tcsh, and you\u0027re not updating that.  The proper way to install local software is to install it into /usr/local/bin, or ask the end user where it should be installed.  Don\u0027t try to have your software modify the path.\r\n\n\n---\n\n@leecow commented on [Thu May 23 2019](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2751#issuecomment-495322072)\n\nThanks for that feedback @grosch. We\u0027ll have a look at making the change. Moving this issue to core-setup. \n\n",

This allows the macOS tool `path_helper` to find it while spawning a new shell:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/blob/e550056ab91de0b5c6b82518a99dab7ccc801f83/src/pkg/packaging/osx/sharedhost/scripts/postinstall#L9-L17\r\n\r\n(This doesn\u0027t appear to assume `bash` to me, but I wasn\u0027t able to find any useful info about how `tcsh` in particular interacts with `path_helper` when I poked around.)\r\n\r\nI traced this down to this PR: https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/840. Apparently we switched from symlinks to `path_helper` to work around a bug, not any reason I\u0027d call significant. 😕\r\n\r\n`path_helper` is apparently a controversial utility based on what I\u0027m finding on the internet. At face value, making a symlink seems simpler and probably more normal, perhaps especially when comparing it against the Linux ecosystem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s precedent, though, of other similar products using `path_helper`:\r\n\r\nThe Mono installer uses it at the moment: [postinstall#L24-L34](https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/c5b88ec4f323f2bdb7c7d0a595ece28dae66579c/packaging/MacSDK/packaging/resources/postinstall#L24-L34). The switch from symlinks to `path_helper` seems to have happened unfortunately without any description here: https://github.com/mono/bockbuild/commit/3e900296aa8eb7ef91fd6cf0b1b6f540c6242d74#diff-d4ed8cbf31db07014a6866e74f3f568b\r\n\r\nGo also apparently currently uses `path_helper`: https://stackoverflow.com/q/38337790. There\u0027s also a brief justification for using it in general:\r\n\r\n\u003e because automatic software installation (and what\u0027s more important UNinstallation) is much easier this way. Many Linux distros switch to .d directories for many configuration files (Apache 2.0 was AFAIK the first program to support this kind of stuff) because it makes administration much easier.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt seems like we *should* be able to depend on `path_helper`. I fully admit I most likely don\u0027t understand the tradeoffs we\u0027re making, though.\r\n\r\n@leecow do you know who\u0027s working on Mono macOS packaging who could weigh in? (Or another macOS installer expert?)\r\n\r\n/cc @dleeapho ",

You really should be writing to /usr/local/dotnet for example and then using symlinks for the binaries from /usr/local/bin/ to your /usr/local/dotnet/bin folder.\r\n\r\n/usr/local/share should be for architecture independent stuff.

If there\u0027s something nasty being avoided by using `path_helper`, I want to know.\r\n\r\n\u003e As soon as someone sets their own path in their startup files, and doesn\u0027t append to what the system gave them, you lose any benefit to using path_helper.\r\n\r\nI think this is a pretty compelling reason to switch. It (or something else about `path_helper`) probably caused https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/2693, and who knows how much trouble for others.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003e If you\u0027re really going to look at changing your installer, I\u0027d ask you also look into why you\u0027re writing to /usr/local/share in the first place and even worse putting a binary at the same level as files and directories vs in a bin directory.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s no need to batch that feedback up with this issue, IMO. Leading up to 3.0, as long as a change is good I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a huge amount of momentum to overcome. If you don\u0027t mind creating a new issue with some specifics about the dangers with the current layout I think that\u0027s a good place to start. (I think Core-Setup is the right place for that discussion too, but I think it\u0027ll be a larger one.)\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s info about the current layout at https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/58/files, although I don\u0027t see that much info *why* some of the longstanding conventions exist.",

This is declared in WinForms so it should be localized there.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether hosting a PropertyGrid for WinForms controls to the end user (not the developer) is still a supported scenario. It was in Desktop Framework but a lot of the designer hosting has been moved outside WinForms into a VS component, so I don\u0027t believe its currently reasonable to host a control designer to the end user? (It still is possible to build custom designers, but I\u0027m not sure if its intended to be used with the WinForms controls, or just is left around to be used by 3rd party report designers and the like.)\r\n\r\nThe team has to comment on their plans in that regard, it may be possible to drop this issue if these properties are no longer designable in hosted designers.\r\n",

The targeting pack RPMs don\u0027t currently have any dependencies, and there are no packages in core-setup that I think make sense to own the `packs` dir since it is only relevant for SDK installs.\r\n\r\nI think having all packs co-own the directories is the way to go, \"[The directory is owned by a package which is not required for your package to function.](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/Revised_File_and_Directory_Ownership#The_directory_is_owned_by_a_package_which_is_not_required_for_your_package_to_function.)\"\r\n\r\nA virtual package for the \"SDK filesystem\" is an alternative, but it would make the set of RPM packages diverge from the set of Debian packages so I don\u0027t see it as a great option.\r\n\r\nI believe the packs also need to co-own `dotnet`, or else that would still be an unowned directory. (For example, someone may have the .NET Core SDK in `~` but want to use the distro-provided targeting packs. If `dotnet` isn\u0027t owned, that dir would stick around after uninstalling the targeting packs.)",

It\u0027s unlikely this will cause problems (details in 3.0/3.1 PRs above) but in any case, it\u0027s a regression in testing coverage that should be closed.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty here is wiring through the info about whether a package should have been created all the way to the test code.

Maybe it\u0027s odd to think about it this way, but it seems like when the SDK replaces content in the apphost template, it\u0027s producing an executable file that \"belongs\" to the developer, so they might expect to own its symbols as well.\r\n\r\nMaybe the replacements the SDK makes are small enough that we should think of this scenario as the dev redistributing a file that\u0027s *largely* unchanged.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@omajid is it possible to strip symbols manually when the file isn\u0027t detected by the packaging tooling?

There are numerous reports of people hitting issues when some packages on their machines come from the Microsoft repos and others from the distro archive. These packages don\u0027t work well together, i.e. they don\u0027t mix well. They have different dotnet roots, /usr/share/dotnet vs. /usr/lib64/dotnet. Here\u0027s one recent report: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/15476\r\n\r\nAdditionally, packages from different distro repositories, i.e. Fedora and RHEL could cause similar issues. Packages are never meant to be mixed, only a single repository should ever be used.\r\n\r\nWe need to find a way to help customers avoid this issue. Better documentation could help, but is not the preferred or only solution. Other packages and application vendors could have found themselves in the same situation. We need to find ways to leverage distro and community knowledge to come up with a proper mitigation.",

I\u0027m surprised that it actually prevents upgrade even when a newer version is available on the less prioritized feed. It certainly makes sense that it works this way though, or it would be a pretty weak feature. 😛 \r\n\r\nYeah, to give a little extra context why it doesn\u0027t help with 5.0: the mix of packages with major.minor in the name (`dotnet-sdk-5.0`) and no version in the name (`dotnet-host`) means that if you try to get `dotnet-sdk-5.0` from a fresh setup, you\u0027ll end up with Microsoft\u0027s `dotnet-sdk-5.0` and Fedora\u0027s `dotnet-host`, and `dotnet` commands will still fail: you end up with a partial install of 3.1 from Fedora and partial install of 5.0 from Microsoft.\r\n\r\n(On the other side, if you *want* to get .NET from packages.microsoft.com, it seems that prioritizing packages.microsoft.com would work, because it\u0027s always a superset as far as .NET packages are concerned.)\r\n\r\nIf we could have fake temporary `dotnet-*-5.0` packages in Fedora that actually just print a warning or something, that seems like it would at least make sure every single package is coming from the one repo with higher priority, preventing the current hostfxr errors that don\u0027t really point people at a solution. But I have no idea if that\u0027s a reasonable thing to do. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003e I needed to run a powershell script so I installed powershell using instructions from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1#fedora.\r\n\r\nThis means to me that we have to have packages.microsoft.com themselves actually put the deprioritization in the central repo config files, because the powershell instructions (and more?) just download and install that packages.microsoft.com repo file.\r\n\r\n\u003e Can we move this issue to source-build repo?\r\n\r\nIt certainly affects the use of distros with source-built SDKs. (/cc @dseefeld @crummel.) But I\u0027m not sure what we can do about this on the source-build side--dotnet/runtime area-Setup is about the Microsoft packaging side of things, so I think it\u0027s correct to be here.",

My understanding is this is waiting for review from the `area-Setup` folks before asking the packages.microsoft.com team to do these changes.\r\n\r\nA few more things to think about:\r\n\r\n* How does this affect the upgrade experience for those who already have .NET installed from packages.microsoft.com with the current priority?\r\n  * Lowest release band, 3.1.111, available in the distro?\r\n  * Higher release band, 3.1.405, not available in the distro?\r\n* What if we prioritize packages.microsoft.com instead?\r\n  * I hope we don\u0027t have to, but it seems worth evaluating even if just to document how it leaves everyone worse off.\r\n* Does all of this behave the same for Debian-based distros? (Future: Alpine?)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMore generally, I want to point out that nothing proposed so far seems to fix all problems--we still need documentation to help people fix up their installs and get the bits installed that they actually want.

We did that for our product and now we decided to use new and shiny background tasks in WinRT and guess what? Microsoft documentation states that background tasks are not supported in self-contained deployments. \r\nSo framework dependent deployments are completely unusable for desktop apps, because we can\u0027t guarantee the framework will be present, because of the lack of framework package but self-contained deployments don\u0027t support core functionality as COM servers.

        "body":  "_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Documentation-unclear-on-whether-the-x64/1415588)._\n\n---\n[severity:It\u0027s more difficult to complete my work]\r\nI\u0027m looking at the [.NET 5.0 download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)\u0026nbsp;and seeing some \"x64\" and \"x86\" installers. Does this just mean that the _installers_\u0026nbsp;are meant to run on those processors, or does it also affect the bitness of the runtime that\u0027s installed? I\u0027d assume that the x86 installer wouldn\u0027t install the 64-bit runtime, but it\u0027s unclear.\n\nI noticed that the .NET Framework has [this helpful page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/64-bit-apps#running-32-bit-vs-64-bit-applications-on-windows) that suggests that the x64 installer will install the 64-bit and 32-bit CLR\u0026nbsp;for .NET Framework, but I couldn\u0027t find the same info in the docs for .NET 5 or .NET Core.\n\nThe use case is that I need to install the runtime on 64-bit machines that may be running 32-bit or 64-bit .NET applications, so I\u0027d like to know whether the x64 installer will suffice, or if I need to also run the x86 installer. There is a strong hint that the x64 installers may include both runtimes due to the command line snippet [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net50#windows-installer) (which I couldn\u0027t actually get to work for some reason), but I would like to know for sure.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 5/6/2021, 07:56 PM: \n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

                                           "body":  "Hi, I know this is an old issue, but I would like to mention that on our systems, there are a few vendor apps we\u0027re testing, compiled using .Net 5 x86 only, originally for a client\u0027s specific industry in which they were being sold 32-bit only tablets. When installing the x86 .NET Redistributable, we\u0027ve ran into exactly what you\u0027ve said, that installing both .NET Redistributables could causes issues. Three SxS errors are logged in Event Viewer at random intervals between every 10 minutes to every 2 hours, even though the application was only opened a couple of times and is not open when the errors are logged. Not sure if this is by design.\n\n`“Activation context generation failed for \"C:\\Application Path\\application.exe\". Error in manifest or policy file \"\" on line . A component version required by the application conflicts with another component version already active. Conflicting components are:. Component 1: C:\\WINDOWS\\WinSxS\\manifests\\x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_(snip)manifest. Component 2: C:\\WINDOWS\\WinSxS\\manifests\\amd64_microsoft.windows.common-controls_(snip).manifest.”`\n\n**According to this issue, the solution:** Uninstall the conflicting 32-bit x86 .NET Redistributable unless you absolutely have to have it. Find the 64-bit version of the application or install VirtualBox/Hyper-V and run old applications there. \n\nI\u0027m making the decision to install Hyper-V on a couple of the tech workstations at the office which automatically and seamlessly configures the system as a Type 1 Hypervisor, and all other VMs are then also Type 1s with direct access. VirtualBox without Hyper-V could also be used, but Type 1 VMs provide significant performance benefits. VirtualBox can be configured to use the Hyper-V hypervisor, however, which may be a more comfortable UI for some.\n\nHope this helps someone else. Surprised this isn\u0027t documented anywhere else.\n",

        "body":  "### Description\n\nI propose that the .net core runtimes set their DisplayIcon registry entry to use C:\\Windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe,0 like the Visual C++ runtimes do. Currently, they use the icon from their individual installer instead. In Windows 10 you can\u0027t tell the difference visually. But in Windows 11, which uses an updated Icon, the icon is out of place. This can be seen on all currently supported versions of .net Core (3.1, 5, 6).\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\ninstall any currently supported .net core runtime and check Control Panel or Settings -\u003eApps -\u003e Apps \u0026 features to see the incorrect icon being used.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe icons shown in Control Panel and Settings -\u003eApps -\u003e Apps \u0026 features for each .net core runtime should be using the icon included in C:\\Windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe like the Visual C++ Redistributables do as it is more uniform that way and it will then rely on icons that are included with the respective Windows version that .net core runtimes will be installed on.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe icons shown in Control Panel and Settings -\u003eApps -\u003e Apps \u0026 features for each .net core runtime is using the icon from their respective installers instead of using the right icon included in windows, which is the icon included in C:\\Windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe.\n\n### Regression?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\na savvy registry user can locate the registry keys in Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall and change DisplayIcon to C:\\Windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe,0 for each entry as they like. This would have to be repeated for every update to .net core runtimes though.\n\n### Configuration\n\nVersion of .net core runtimes: all supported versions (3.1, 5, 6)\r\nInstalled OS Version: Windows 11 x64 21H2 22000.258\r\nThis is not specific to the above listed configuration\n\n### Other information\n\n_No response_",

I see the same issue on 22.04. It seems that Ubuntu-built .NET packages are not cleaning these files from the machine. This seems by design, as plain `apt remove` command does not remove configuration files, i.e. anything under `/etc`. To remove those, you\u0027d run the command with `--purge` switch, i.e. `apt remove --purge dotnet* aspnet* netstandard*`. I\u0027ll update the guidance document.",

I see the same issue on 22.04. It seems that Ubuntu-built .NET packages are not cleaning these files from the machine. This seems by design, as plain `apt remove` command does not remove configuration files, i.e. anything under `/etc`. To remove those, you\u0027d run the command with `--purge` switch, i.e. `apt remove --purge dotnet* aspnet* netstandard*`. I\u0027ll update the guidance document.\r\n\r\nJust in case, I checked the steps you provided there, and they are working fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Checking dotnet6 is not installed\r\nroot@Jdotnet:~# dpkg -l | grep dotnet\r\nroot@Jdotnet:~# \r\n\r\n# Installing dotnet6 on Jammy\r\nroot@Jdotnet:~# apt install dotnet6\r\nReading package lists...

One indication of this is that:\n1. we (Canonical) do not build a binary package with the name `dotnet-runtime-deps-8.0` and\n2. the version numbers you are upgrading from do not contain an `ubuntu…` suffix.\n\nUnfortunately the Microsoft and Canonical built packages are incompatible and can result in the errors reported here. Because of this reason Microsoft gradually started to no longer built packages for platforms that provide their own packages.\n\nTo prevent such migration issues you have to do one of the following things:\n1. Remove the MS package feed\n2. Configure apt to not install dotnet packages from the MS package feed (if you depend on other packages from the MS package feed)\n3. Configure apt to not install dotnet packages from the Ubuntu package feed (if you prefer the dotnet packages from the MS package feed)\n\nSee the documentation for additional context and detailed instructions how to do that: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-package-mixup?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#whats-going-on\n\nLet me know if this advice helps!",

        "body":  "### Description\n\nSimilar to #82518, but not quite the same. With .NET 6.0.29 the version of `vcruntime140_cor3.dll` has been raised to `14.38.33135.0`. The same DLL in .NET 8.0.4 however is still on version `14.38.33130.0`. If upgrading a self-contained app from a MSI to an application that uses .NET 8 I get errors in the Microsoft Installer installation.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a new application (e.g. dotnet new console -f net6.0)\r\n1. Create a global.json (e.g. dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 6.0.\u003cnewest\u003e)\r\n1. Publish the app as self-contained application (e.g. dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true -r win-x64)\r\n1. Bundle the application as MSI file (e.g. use WiX toolset or skip this step for now)\r\n1. Repeat steps 1 to 4 for .NET 8.0 (-f net8.0 and --sdk-version 8.0.\u003cnewest\u003e)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe latest DLLs for .NET self contained builds will be deployed when installing using MSI if there is a previous installation using .NET 6.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nA downgrade is detected and the installation fails.\n\n### Regression?\n\nSee #82518 and #62218.\n\n### Known Workarounds\n\nUse companions in Windows Installer / WiX toolset.\n\n### Configuration\n\n_No response_\n\n### Other information\n\n_No response_",

As a result, referencing an installed nethost on a machine is extremely difficult. In vcxproj scenarios, nethost can be consumed by a NuGet package reference, but from CMake, there\u0027s no good solution. Given that the consumers of nethost are primarily native developers, having a native development-focused discovery story is important.\r\n\r\nFor Unix-based platforms, we should update our installers to install the nethost in the standard location, so linking to nethost via `-lnethost` works seamlessly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we should ship a CMake config module for nethost that will be discoverable by CMake\u0027s config-style package discovery on all of our target systems, enabling CMake projects to reference nethost with `find_package(nethost)` and `target_link_libraries` seamlessly.",
